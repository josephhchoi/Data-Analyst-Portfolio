    "#### Response:\n",
    "Entropy of X came out bigger than entropy of Y as the distribution of X is uniform (constant probability of 0.2 from x=1 to x=5). This trait maximizes uncertainty since there is no preference for any specific value. Distribution of Y is less uniform with staggered probabilities from y=1 to y=5. This reduces the uncertainty of Y's outcome. "
