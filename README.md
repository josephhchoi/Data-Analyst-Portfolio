# Data Analyst Portfolio

Hello everyone, my name is Joseph. Welcome to my GitHub!

## Introduction
**A bit about me**: I've gone through many career pivots, almost too many to count. I felt hopeless in finding my passion and an industry that I would want to fully commit to. Then I found data analysis, and through data analysis, I discovered the world of data science. It felt like a match made in heaven for me as the responsibilities align perfectly with my personality and interests. For the first time in a long time, I felt full confidence in an industry, which motivated me to learn and explore further.

## Education and Training
To pursue my newfound passion, I dedicated myself to acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge. I have completed a wide range of data analyst and data science certifications, which have equipped me with valuable expertise in this field. Additionally, I participated in an intensive data analytics boot camp, where I honed my analytical skills and learned to work with real-world data challenges.

Driven by my desire to excel in the data domain, I also decided to pursue a bachelorâ€™s degree in data science (expected grad date: Aug 2024). This commitment reflects my determination to go all-in with this data route and continually expand my capabilities as a data analyst and scientist.

## Purpose of this GitHub
In this GitHub repository, I aim to use this platform to share my data analysis and data science projects with everyone. It serves as a showcase of my passion, dedication, and interest in the field. Through my projects, I hope to demonstrate my problem-solving abilities, analytical skills, and creativity in tackling various data-related challenges.
