OLD WAREHOUSE, RUSSIA - NIGHT 30 A train speeds by. CAMERA PULLS through the warehouse window and MOVES UP to the third floor where NATASHA ROMANOFF aka BLACK WIDOW, is tied to a chair. A man slaps her. She screams. GEORGI LUCHKOV (in Russian) This isn’t how I wanted this evening to go. NATASHA (in Russian) I know how you wanted this evening. Believe me this is better. GEORGI LUCHKOV (in Russian) Who are you working for? Lermentov, yes? TALL THUG walks over to Natasha and leans the chair over a pit. She becomes scared. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 13. GEORGI LUCHKOV (CONT’D) (in Russian) Does he think we have to go through him to move our cargo? NATASHA (in Russian) I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business. GEORGI LUCHKOV (in Russian) Solohob. A bagman, a front. Your outdated information betrays you. The famous Black Widow is just another pretty face. NATASHA (in Russian) You really think I’m pretty? TALL THUG grabs her jaw and forces it open as Luchkov walks to the table behind him. GEORGI LUCHKOV (in Russian) Tell Lermentov we don’t need him to move the tanks. Tell him he is out. Well... Luchkov picks up a tool of the table and plays with it. ...You may have to write it. Suddenly a phone rings. WEASELLY THUG answers his phone. WEASELLY THUG It’s for her. Luchkov takes the phone. GEORGI LUCHKOV (in Russian; into cell) You listen carefully- AGENT COULSON (V.O) (over the cell) You’re at 1- 14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.

NATASHA (into cell) I’m in the middle of an interrogation, and this moron is giving me everything. GEORGI LUCHKOV (to Tall Thug) I not- give everything. Natasha gives Luchkov a look. BEGIN INTERCUT: COULSON / NATASHA NATASHA (into cell) Look, you can’t pull me out of this right now. AGENT COULSON (into cell) Natasha...Barton’s been compromised. NATASHA (into cell) Let me put you on hold. Luchkov moves in for the cell phone. Natasha kicks him between the legs and headbutts him. WEASELLY THUG swings his fist at her and she kicks him back.

AGENT COULSON (into phone) We think so. Coulson is looking at a screen that’s playing a video of Hawkeye & Black Widow in Budapest. We’ll brief you on everything when you get back. Coulson is handed a folder. He walks down some stairs as he talks. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy. NATASHA (into cell) Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me. AGENT COULSON Oh I’ve got Stark! You get the big guy.

CALCUTTA WOMAN approaches her. BRUCE BANNER, the alter ego of the Incredible Hulk, is treating the ill in the b.g. CALCUTTA WOMAN (in Hindi) Who are you? Get out! There is sickness here! YOUNG GIRL (very fast in Hindi) Are you the doctor? I need a doctor. My father. My father’s not waking up! He has a fever and he’s moaning but his eyes won’t open. Banner hears and moves over to the YOUNG GIRL. He kneels before her. BANNER (in Hindi) Slow down. YOUNG GIRL (in Hindi) My father- BANNER (in Hindi) Like them? Banner points to the people in the house that are sick. YOUNG GIRL nods and holds up a wad of cash. YOUNG GIRL (in Hindi; emotion) Please!17. 32 EXT. OLD ABANDONED SHACK, CALCUTTA OUTSKIRTS - LATER 32 YOUNG GIRL is rushing to reach the shack but Banner, a little suspicious, grabs her -- slowing her down.

OLD ABANDONED SHACK - CONTINUOUS 33 Banner enters in time to see her escape through the window. He’s been ditched and he realizes he’s been set up. BANNER (quietly to himself) Should have got paid upfront Banner. NATASHA You know, for a man who’s supposed to be... Natasha reveals herself to Banner from behind a curtain. NATASHA (CONT’D) ...avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. BANNER (putting his bag down) Avoiding stress isn’t the secret. NATASHA Then what is it? Yoga? BANNER And you brought me to the end of the city. Smart. (peeping through the window) I- uh- I assume the whole place is surrounded. Natasha removes her scarf. NATASHA Just you and me. BANNER And your actress buddy? She a spy too, they start that wrong? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 18. NATASHA (a little nervous) I did. BANNER Who are you? NATASHA Natasha Romanoff. BANNER Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff? ’Cause that’s not going to work out for everyone. NATASHA No, no. Of course not. I’m here on behalf of SHIELD. BANNER (a little mad) SHIELD. How’d they find me? NATASHA We never lost you, Doctor. We’ve kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent. BANNER Why? NATASHA Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now we need you to come in. BANNER What if I say no? NATASHA (seductive, sturn, smiling) I’ll persuade you. BANNER (a little sad and reluctant) And what if the- Other Guy says no? NATASHA You’ve been more than a year without an incident. I don’t think you want to break that streak. Banner pushes at an old wooden cradle, it creaks. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 19. BANNER Well, I don’t every time get what I want. NATASHA Doctor, we’re facing a potential global catastrophe. BANNER (chuckles) Oh those I actively try to avoid. NATASHA This (takes a seat) is the Tesseract. Natasha slides a cell phone along the table. On it is an image of the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet. Banner puts on his glasses, approaches and picks up the touch screen cell phone. BANNER What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it? NATASHA He wants you to find it. It’s been taken. It emits a Gamma signature that’s too weak for us to trace. No one knows Gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that’s where I’d be. BANNER So Fury isn’t after the monster? NATASHA Not that he’s told me. BANNER And he tells you everything? NATASHA Talk to Fury, he needs you on this. BANNER (immediate response) He needs me in a cage? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 20. NATASHA No one’s going to put you in a- BANNER STOP LYING TO ME! Banner yells, crashing his hands down on the table. Natasha stands, pulling a gun and aims at him. He draws back, smiling. I’m sorry. That was mean. (smiles) I just wanted to see what you’d do. Natasha stares at him, a little teary, scared out of her mind. Why don’t we do this the easy way where you don’t use that and the- Other Guy doesn’t make a mess? Okay?....Natasha. Natasha lowers her weapon and speaks into an earpiece. NATASHA (quietly into her earpiece) Stand down. We’re good here. The horde of armed guards surrounding the shack lower their weapons. BANNER Just you and me? Natasha realizes he knows and stands silent. 34 INT. DARK ROOM, CARRIER - NIGHT 34 Fury is talking with the Council, four shadowy figures on screens. COUNCILMAN This is out of line, Director. You’re dealing with forces you can’t control. FURY You ever been in a war, councilman? In a fire fight? Did you feel an over abundance of control? COUNCILMAN You’re saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 21. FURY Not Asgard, Loki. COUNCILWOMAN He can’t be working alone. What about the other one, his brother? FURY Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile. But he’s worlds away and we can’t depend on him to help either. It’s up to us. COUNCILMAN Which is why you should be focusing on Phase Two, it was designed for exactly this purpose. FURY Phase Two isn’t ready; our enemy is. We need a response team. COUNCILMAN The Avengers Initiative was shut down. FURY This isn’t about the Avengers. COUNCILMAN We’re running the world’s greatest covert security network and you’re gonna leave the fate of the human race to a handful of freaks. FURY I’m not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people may be isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe, with the right push, they can be exactly what we need. COUNCILWOMAN You believe! COUNCILMAN War isn’t won by sentiment, Director. FURY No, It’s won by soldiers.22. 35 INT. GYM - NIGHT 35 STEVE ROGERS, alter ego of Captain America, is hitting a punching bag in a gym. He has several flashbacks of World War Two. During his flashbacks... CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O) There’s not enough time. I gotta put her in the water. ...he hits the bag harder, faster... PEGGY CARTER (V.O) You won’t be alone. ...he hits the bag even faster. SCIENTIST (V.O) Oh my God. This guy’s still alive. Steve throws the hardest punch he has left and it knocks the bag across the room. Breathing hard, Steve picks up another bag from a line on the floor and hangs it up. He begins to hit it. And- FURY (across the room) Trouble sleeping? STEVE (hitting the bag) Slept for seventy years, Sir. I think I’ve had my fill. Fury slowly approaches Steve. FURY Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. STEVE When I went under, the world was at war. I wake up- they say we won. They didn’t say what we lost. FURY We’ve made some mistakes along the way, some very recently. STEVE (removing hand wrap) You here with a mission, Sir? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 23. FURY I am. STEVE (removing other hand wrap) Trying to get me back in the world? FURY Trying to save it. Fury hands Steve a folder with information on the Tesseract in it. STEVE HYDRA’s secret weapon. FURY Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think. The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That’s something the world sorely needs. STEVE Who took it from you? FURY He’s called Loki. He’s- not from around here. There’s a lot we’ll have to bring you up to speed on if you’re in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know. STEVE At this point I doubt anything would surprise me. Steve gets up, grabs his duffel bag, and another punching bag while Fury is talking. FURY Ten bucks says you’re wrong. There’s a debriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 24. STEVE You should have left it in the ocean. Steve exits. 36 EXT. OCEAN, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT 36 IRON MAN aka Tony Stark, is underwater. He attaches a device to a massive pipe. He flies up out of the water and towards the city and begins talking with PEPPER POTTS. IRON MAN Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.

Iron Man flies over a overpass & up the side of Stark Tower. PEPPER (V.O) (over Iron Man headset) I’m in DC tomorrow. I’m working on the zoning for the next three buildings. TONY (V.O) (over Iron Man headset) Pepper, you’re killing me at the moment. Remember, enjoy the moment. 39 EXT.

PENTHOUSE, STARK TOWER - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 40 Pepper stands in front of a holographic display, a little confused. PEPPER Levels are holding steady- I think. Tony approaches Pepper. TONY Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which leads me to my next question. How does it feel to be a genius? Tony turns off the display and Pepper and he face each other. PEPPER Well, ah, I really wouldn’t know now would I? TONY What do you mean? All this came from you. PEPPER No, all this came from that. Pepper taps Tony’s arc reactor. TONY Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself- twelve percent of the credit. PEPPER Twelve percent?TONY An argument can be made for fifteen. Pepper walks toward the living room. PEPPER Twelve percent of my baby? TONY (following Pepper) Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things and sorry but, the security snafu? That was on you. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 27. PEPPER Oh! TONY My private elevator. Pepper pours champagne in two glasses. PEPPER You mean our elevator. TONY Yeah, it was teeming with sweaty workmen. I’m going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later aren’t I? PEPPER Not gonna be that subtle. TONY I’ll tell you what, next building is gonna say ’Potts’ on the tower. PEPPER On the lease! TONY Call your mum, can you bunk over? JARVIS Sir, the telephone. I’m afraid my protocols are being overridden. TONY Ah- Tony picks up his high-tech phone and holds up. AGENT COULSON (on phone screen) Mr. Stark, we need to talk. TONY You have reached the Life Model Decoy of Tony Stark. Please leave a message. AGENT COULSON (on phone screen) This is urgent. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 28. TONY Then leave it urgently.

AGENT COULSON I can’t stay. TONY Uh, his first name is Agent. PEPPER Come on in, we’re celebrating. TONY (fake smiling) Which is why he can’t stay. AGENT COULSON (handing Tony the laptop) We need you to look this over, as soon as possible. Tony stares at the laptop. TONY I don’t like being handed things. PEPPER That’s fine because I love to be handed things. So, let’s trade. Pepper swaps with Coulson -- he has with her glass and she has the laptop. She then takes Tony’s glass and passes the laptop on to him. Thank you. TONY Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 29. AGENT COULSON This isn’t a consultation. PEPPER Is this about the Avengers? Coulson looks at Pepper Which I know nothing about. TONY The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought, and I didn’t even qualify. PEPPER I didn’t know that either. TONY Yeah, apparently I’m volatile, self-obsessed, don’t play well with others. PEPPER That I did know. AGENT COULSON This isn’t about personality profiles anymore. TONY Whatever! Ms. Potts, got a sec? PEPPER Half a moment. Pepper leaves Coulson at the door and goes over to Tony. TONY You know, I thought we were having a moment. PEPPER I was having twelve percent of a moment. Tony gives Pepper a look. This seems serious. Phil looks pretty shaken. TONY How would you notice- why is he Phil? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (5) 30. PEPPER What is all this? TONY This is- ah... Tony grabs the holograms on the laptop and throws them up. Holograms fill the room, each is a article on one of the Avengers. ...this! They both look upon the screens, observing them. PEPPER I’m going to take the jet to DC tonight. TONY Tomorrow. PEPPER You have homework. You have a lot of homework. TONY Well, what if I didn’t? PEPPER If you didn’t? You mean when you finished? Well, um, then- She leans in and whispers in Tony’s ear. TONY Square deal. Fly safe. They kiss. Coulson looks away. PEPPER Work hard. (approaching Coulson) So, any chance you’re driving by LaGuardia? AGENT COULSON I can drop you off. PEPPER (O.S) Fantastic. Ooh, I want to hear about the ah- cellist, is that still a thing? As they are talking, Tony sees the Tesseract -- It peaks his interest.

FACELESS PILOT (to Coulson) We’re about forty minutes out from home base, Sir. Coulson stands from a chair and walks over to Steve. STEVE So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me? AGENT COULSON A lot of people were. You were the world’s first superhero. Banner thought Gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine’s original formula. STEVE Didn’t really go his way, did it? AGENT COULSON Not so much. When he’s not that thing though, guy’s like a Stephen Hawking. Rogers looks confused. He’s like a- smart person. I gotta say- it’s an honor to meet you, officially. I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. I mean, I was, I was present, while you were unconscious from-the-ice. Steve moves over to the cockpit and Coulson follows (MORE) (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 32. AGENT COULSON (CONT’D) You know it’s really- it’s just a- just a huge honor to have you on board- it’s... STEVE Well, I hope I’m the man for the job. AGENT COULSON Oh you are, absolutely. Ah- we made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input. STEVE The uniform? Aren’t the stars and stripes a little...old-fashioned? AGENT COULSON Everything that’s happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old-fashioned. 43 INT.

I will lead them in a glorious battle. THE OTHER Battle? Against the meager might of Earth. LOKI Glorious not lengthy- if your force is as formidable as you claim. THE OTHER You question us? You question him? He who out the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose? When you were cast out- defeated! (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 33. LOKI I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard, betrayed. THE OTHER Your ambition is little, full of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil. LOKI You don’t have the Tesseract yet. The Chitauri creature lunges at Loki, hissing. I don’t threaten. But until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words. THE OTHER You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice, where he cannot find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain. 45 INT. LOKI’S LIAR, UNDERGROUND LAB - CONTINUOUS 45 Loki comes back and he flinches. He stares, mad. 46 EXT.

Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? STEVE Trading cards? NATASHA They’re vintage. He’s very proud. They see Banner who is bumping into people while he observes the carrier. STEVE Doctor Banner. BANNER Oh, yeah, hi. They told me you’d be coming. STEVE Word is you can find the Cube. BANNER Is that the only word on me? STEVE Only word I care about. BANNER Must be strange for you, all of this. STEVE Well, this is actually kind of familiar. NATASHA Gentlemen, you might wanna step inside in a minute. It’s gonna get a little had to breathe. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 35. HELICARRIER INTERCOM Flight Mode. Secure the deck. There is a loud whirring and clunking sound and Banner and Rodgers make their way to the edge of the helicarrier. STEVE Is this a submarine? BANNER Really, they want me in a submerged pressurized metal container? Propellers begin to spin and the carrier begins to lift into the air. Oh no, this is much worse. The helicarrier begins ascending higher and higher. 48 INT. BRIDGE, CARRIER - MINUTES LATER 48 Rogers and Banner follow Natasha into the bridge.

BANNER Thanks for asking nicely. So, um, how long am I staying? FURY Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you’re in the wind. BANNER Well where are you with that? AGENT COULSON We’re sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cell phones... Steve stands in the b.g. confused of what’s being said. While Coulson is talking, Natasha moves over to a computer screen where we see Barton’s face trace in progress. She checks the stats. ...laptops, if it’s connected to a satellite, it’s eyes and ears for us. NATASHA It’s still not gonna find them in time. BANNER You have to narrow your field. How many Spectrometers do you have access to? FURY How many are there? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 37. BANNER Call every lab you know. Tell them to put the Spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for Gamma rays. I’ll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work? FURY Agent Romanoff, would you show Doctor Banner to his laboratory, please? Natasha walks over to Banner and they begin walking out of the bridge area. NATASHA You’re gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys. BANNER Really? Do you have the com-meter sixty-four? NATASHA I’m not sure- BANNER (cutting her off) Oh you’re very young. Fury walks up to Hill. FURY Hill, did you tell the council that Barton had been compromised? MARIA HILL Was that not procedure? Fury walks off the bridge and onto the air deck, where he looks out. MARIA HILL (CONT’D) Did you tell them who exactly is on your response team? Fury looks over his shoulder. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 38. FURY Doesn’t appear that I have to. 51 INT. LOKI’S LIAR, UNDERGROUND LAB - DAY 51 Selvig is working on a machine in Loki’s hidden base. SELVIG Put it over there. (to Barton) Where did you find all these people? BARTON SHIELD has no shortage of enemies, Doctor. This the stuff you need? SELVIG Yeah. Iridium. It’s found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It’s very hard to get hold of. BARTON Especially if SHIELD knows you need it. SELVIG Well, I didn’t know. Loki walks up. (to Loki) Hey! This is wonderful. The Tesseract has shown me so much. It’s- it’s more than knowledge, it’s truth. LOKI I know. It, ah- it touches everyone differently. (to Barton) What did it show you Agent Barton? BARTON My next target. SELVIG (laughing) Stick in the mud. He’s got no soul. No wonder you chose this, this tomb to work in. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 39. BARTON (snapping) Well, the Radisson doesn’t have three levels of lead lined flooring between SHIELD and that Cube. Selvig walks back to the machine he was working on. LOKI I see why Fury chose you to guard it. BARTON You’re going to have to contend with him sir. As long as he’s in the air, I can’t pin him down. And he’ll be putting together a team. LOKI Are they a threat? BARTON To each other more than likely. But if Fury can get ’em on track, and he might, they could throw some noise our way. LOKI You admire Fury. BARTON He’s got a clear line of sight. LOKI Is that why you failed to kill him? BARTON It might be. I was disoriented, and I’m not at my best with a gun. LOKI I want to know everything you can tell me about this team of his. I would- test their mettle. Barton nods. I am weary of scuttling in shadow. I mean to rule this world, not burrow in it. BARTON That’s a risk (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 40. LOKI Oh yes. BARTON If you’re set on making yourself known. I could be useful. LOKI Tell me what you need. Barton walks over to a small case, opens it, then takes out his bow. He flicks it open. BARTON I need a distraction. And an eyeball. 52 INT. BRIDGE, CARRIER - DAY 52 Coulson and Steve are standing in the bridge, just waiting. AGENT JASPER SITWELL is in the b.g. running the face trace. AGENT COULSON I mean, if it’s not too much trouble. STEVE No-no, it’s fine. AGENT COULSON It’s a vintage set. Took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges but- AGENT JASPER SITWELL We got a hit. Sixty seven percent match. Wait- cross-match, seventy nine percent. AGENT COULSON Location? AGENT JASPER SITWELL Stuttgart, Germany. Twenty eight, Königstraße. He’s not exactly hiding. FURY Captain, you’re up. Steve nods and walks off.41. 53 EXT. FANCY BUILDING, STUTTGART - NIGHT 53 A busy street. Cars pull up and drop off fancy guests. 54 INT. FANCY BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 54 String quartet No. 13 is playing in a large ballroom filled with people talking, mingling. 55 INT. ROOM, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 55 Steve walks through a door and in a case is the new and improved CAPTAIN AMERICA suit. He walks over to it and stares. 56 EXT. GUARDED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 56 Two guards outside are shot down with arrows while securing the building. 57 EXT. QUINJET, SKIES - CONTINUOUS 57 The quinjet is speeding across the cloudy skies, making its way to Germany. 58 EXT. DOOR, GUARDED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 58 Barton and some men rush over to a door with a scanner on the side. They prepare to break in. 59 INT. FANCY BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 59 Loki walks down some stairs from a balcony. GALA SCIENTIST is at a podium talking. Loki hits a man with his scepter, knocking him to the floor. The guests stop and stare in awe. Loki swiftly grabs the GALA SCIENTIST -- flips him onto a statue and then uses a device to bore into his eye. The guests scatter in horror, screaming, running away as Loki smiles menacingly. 60 EXT. DOOR, GUARDED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 60 The image of the eye is transported to a similar device Barton is holding over a retina scanner. The door opens. 61 INT. ROOM, GUARDED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 61 Barton runs in and steals takes a glass tube containing the Iridium.42. 62 EXT. FANCY BUILDING, STUTTGART - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 62 People flee the gala, screaming, and Loki follows, taking on his Asgardian attire. He blasts a Polizei (police) car speeding toward him, flipping it over. He creates duplicates of himself, surrounding a mob of gala people. LOKI Kneel before me. I said- KNEEL! The people hurry, dropping to their knees. (walking through the mob) Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It’s the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life’s joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made- to be ruled. In the end- you will always kneel. A German old man gets to his feet. GERMAN OLD MAN Not to men like you. LOKI There are no men like me. GERMAN OLD MAN There are always men like you. LOKI Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. Loki fires his scepter but Captain America jumps in front of the man -- deflecting the beam off his shield causing it to hit Loki, who falls to the ground. CAPTAIN AMERICA You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing. LOKI The soldier- Loki rises to his feet. -the man out of time. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 43. CAPTAIN AMERICA I’m not the one who’s out of time. The quinjet comes in behind Cap with Black Widow inside. A gun unfolds from the underside of the plane. NATASHA (over speaker) Loki, drop the weapon and stand down. Loki fires at the jet and it banks hard to avoid it. Cap attacks Loki and the two fight. Loki knocks Cap’s shield to the side and forces him down with his scepter. LOKI Kneel! CAPTAIN AMERICA Not today. Cap jumps up and does a spin-kick to Loki’s face. The two continue to fight. 63 INT. COCKPIT, QUINJET - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 63 Natasha, in her Black Widow suit, is trying to figure out how to take a shot. NATASHA (to co-pilot) Guy’s all over the place. TONY (over earpiece) Agent Romanoff, you miss me? The computer screen shows the message ’PA SYSTEMS OVERRIDE’, and AC/DC’s, ’Shoot to Thrill’ begins to play. Natasha smiles heavily. Iron Man flies down and fires a repulsor blast, knocking Loki down. IRON MAN Make a move reindeer games. Loki’s Asgardian garb fades away and he raises his hands. Good move. Cap walks over to Iron Man. The quinjet begins to land in the b.g. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 44. CAPTAIN AMERICA Mister Stark. IRON MAN Captain. 64 EXT. DARKENED CLOUDY SKIES - NIGHT 64 DOLLY IN on some mountains in the distance...the quinjet speeds by. 65 INT. COCKPIT, QUINJET - CONTINUOUS 65 Natasha is piloting the plane. Loki is strapped down in the back of the plane. Cap, in suit but no cowl, and Tony, in the suit but without the helmet, is standing behind the cockpit and they talking. FURY (over quinjet radio) He saying anything? NATASHA (into headset) Not a word. FURY (over quinjet radio) Just get him here, we’re low on time. 66 INT. QUINJET - CONTINUOUS 66 STEVE I don’t like it. TONY What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily? STEVE I don’t remember it being that easy. This guy packs a wallop. TONY Still, you were pretty spry, for an older fellow. What’s your thing? Pilates? STEVE What? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 45. TONY It’s like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple of things. Y’know, doing time as a Cap-sicle. STEVE Fury didn’t tell me he was calling you in. TONY Yeah, there’s a lot of things Fury doesn’t tell you. There’s a flash of lightening and a roar of thunder. NATASHA Where’s this come from? Loki leans forward, looking around. STEVE (to Loki) What’s the matter? Scared of a little lightening? LOKI I’m not overly fond of what follows. Loki looks to the sky. 67 EXT. DARKENED STORMY SKIES - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 67 There’s a crash on top of the quinjet. Something as landed. 68 INT. QUINJET - CONTINUOUS 68 Tony, Steve, and Natasha look up. SHOCKED and JOLTED. 69 EXT. DARKENED STORMY SKIES - CONTINUOUS 69 There seems to be a shadowy figure holding onto the quinjet. We make it out -- this is THOR ODINSON, God of Thunder. He is serious. There’s another flash of light. 70 INT. QUINJET - CONTINUOUS 70 Natasha speeds up. Steve runs for something, he grabs his cowl while Tony grabs his helmet which attaches itself to the suit. Tony pushes a button and opens the ramp of the jet. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 46. CAPTAIN AMERICA What are you doing? Thor enters, jumping down on the ramp. He hits Iron Man away, causing him to fall on Cap. He grabs Loki by the neck and jumps out of the plane. IRON MAN Now there’s that guy. NATASHA Another Asgardian? CAPTAIN AMERICA That guy’s a friendly. NATASHA Doesn’t matter. If he frees Loki, or kills him, the Tesseract’s lost. Iron Man begins walking to the edge of the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA Stark, we need a plan of attack. IRON MAN I have a plan. Attack! Iron Man flies out of the jet and Cap makes for a parachute. NATASHA I’d sit this one out, Cap. CAPTAIN AMERICA I don’t see how I can. NATASHA These guys come from legend, they’re basically Gods. CAPTAIN AMERICA There’s only one God ma’am, and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t dress like that. Cap straps on the chute, grabs his shield, and dives out the plane, head first.47. 71 EXT. CLIFF TOP - NIGHT 71 Thor and Loki crash down on a cliff. Thor throws Loki to the ground, he groans. THOR Where is the Tesseract? LOKI Oh-ho, I missed you too. THOR Do I look to be in a gaming mood? LOKI Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone, how many dark energy did the All-Father have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth. Thor drops his hammer, Mjolnir, and pulls Loki to his feet. THOR I thought you dead. LOKI Did you mourn? THOR We all did. Our father- LOKI Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? THOR We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that? LOKI I remember a shadow, living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I who was and should be king! THOR So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights? No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 48. LOKI Well yes. THOR Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill. Loki pushes past Thor and walks away, Thor follows. LOKI I’ve seen worlds you’ve never known about. I have grown, Odinson, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it- THOR Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king? LOKI I am a king! THOR Not here. You give up the Tesseract; you give up this poisonous dream! You come home. LOKI I don’t have it. Thor summons Mjolnir and holds it ready. You need the Cube to bring me home but I’ve sent it off I know not where. THOR You listen well brother- Iron Man flies in, knocking him and Thor out of frame. Loki stands waiting. LOKI I’m listening? 72 EXT. FOREST - SECONDS LATER 72 Thor and Iron Man crash through the trees to the ground, Tony lifts his faceplate. THOR Do not touch me again. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 49. TONY Then don’t take my stuff. THOR You have no idea what you’re dealing with. TONY Uh- Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you wear-th her drapes? THOR This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice. TONY He gives up the Cube, he’s all yours. Until then- Faceplate drops. IRON MAN -stay out of the way. Iron Man takes a few steps. Tourist. Thor throws Mjolnir, hitting Iron Man square in the chest, sending him flying, landing on his back. INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET: TONY Okay! BACK TO SCENE: Loki smirks from the cliff top as Thor summons Mjolnir then swings it in circles. Iron Man gets to his feet and fires a repulse blast at Thor, then flies at him, kicking him through a tree. Thor stands, summoning a bolt of lightning as Loki watches in the distance. Thor sends the bolt at Iron Man. INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET: JARVIS Power at four hundred percent capacity. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 50. TONY How bout that? BACK TO SCENE: Iron Man fires at Thor. The two stand ready then fly at each other, smashing through the trees and scraping up a cliff side. Trees are toppled as they crash to the forest grounds. Thor and Iron Man stand quickly. Thor sends in a left hook so Iron Man is about to punch but Thor grabs his fist. Iron Man is about to send in his left hook and Thor grabs that too. Thor begins to crush Iron Man’s right gauntlet with ease. INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET: Tony looks at the HUD which is alerting him. He groans and thinks. BACK TO SCENE: Iron Man lifts his palm, that is being crushed, and he fires a blast at Thor’s face -- it does nothing to Thor so he head butts him. Thor headbutts him back. Iron Man flies back, coming to a stop before launching himself at Thor. Iron Man throws Thor into a broken tree. Thor then stands and the two go at it for a bit longer -- a fist fight. Thor summons his hammer about to slam down on the chest of Tony but Iron Man ditches, causing Thor to fall. Behind the rising Thor, Iron Man swoops in and punches him. They get ready to sends blows at each other until Cap’s shield ricochets off both their chest. CAPTAIN AMERICA (O.S) Hey! Cap catches his shield. CAPTAIN AMERICA That’s enough! He jumps down of the tree and approaches Thor and Iron Man. Now I don’t know what you plan on doing here- THOR I’ve come here to put an end to Loki’s schemes! (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 51. CAPTAIN AMERICA Then prove it. Put that hammer down. IRON MAN Uh, yeah! No! Bad call, he loves his hammer- Thor swings his hammer back, sending Iron Man behind him. THOR You want me to put hammer down? Thor leaps, swinging Mjolnir, Cap raises the shield over his head. When the two connect there is a loud boom and a flash of light. The three are thrown backwards. They slowly get to their feet and come together. CAPTAIN AMERICA Are we done here? Thor looks around. 73 EXT. HELICARRIER, SKIES - NIGHT 73 The helicarrier flies through the clouds. 74 INT. HALL, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 74 Loki is escorted down the halls by a troop of armed guards. He walks past a window -- the wishbone lab, where Banner is working. Loki smiles through the window at him. Banner removes his glasses and rubs his temples. 75 INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 75 Loki is locked in a cylindrical glass cage. Fury walks in and over to a control panel. FURY In case it’s unclear, you try to escape- you so much as scratch that glass- Fury pushes a button and the floor beneath the cell drops away to nothing, the wind screams. Thirty thousand feet straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works? He pushes a button and closes the floor. He gestures first to Loki. Ant. (gestures to panel) Boot. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 52. LOKI It’s an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me. FURY Built for something a lot stronger than you. LOKI Oh I’ve heard. (turns to a camera)... 76 INT. CONFERENCE TABLE, BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 76 On the glass table a monitor is up -- Loki on it, watching it is Natasha. As Loki talks she looks up at Banner. Banner looks at her, smirking about her cage comment earlier. ...A mindless beast- makes play he’s still a man... We see Thor listen intently. ...How desperate are you, that you call on such lost creatures to defend you? FURY (V.O) How desperate am I? ... 77 INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 77 Fury moves toward the cage slowly. ...You threaten my world with war, you steal a force you can’t hope to control, you talk about peace and you kill ’cause it’s fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did. LOKI Ooh. It burns you to have come so close, to have the Tesseract, to have power- unlimited power, and for what? (smiles and faces the camera) A... 78 INT. BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 78 Hill is watching Loki on a screen too. ...warm light for all mankind to share?53. 79 INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 79 Loki faces Fury again. And then to be reminded what real power is. Fury smiles. FURY Well, let me know if ’real power’ wants a magazine or something. Fury exits. 80 INT. CONFERENCE TABLE, BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 80 The monitor on Cap’s side of the table turns off. Steve, in suit with no cowl, looks up. BANNER He really grows on you doesn’t he? STEVE Loki’s gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what’s his play? THOR He has an army called the Chitauri. They’re not of Asgard nor any world known. He means to lead the against your people. They will win him the Earth, in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract. STEVE An army, from outer space? BANNER So, he’s building another portal. That’s what he needs Erik Selvig for. THOR Selvig? BANNER He’s an astrophysicist. THOR He’s a friend. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 54. NATASHA Loki has them under some kind of spell- along with one of ours. STEVE I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He’s not leading an army from here. BANNER I don’t think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you can small crazy on him. THOR Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason but he is of Asgard, and he is my brother. NATASHA He killed eighty people in two days. THOR He’s adopted? BANNER I think it’s about the mechanics. Iridium, what do they need the Iridium for? Tony and Coulson come walking in. TONY It’s a stabilizing agent. (to Coulson, quietly) I’m saying, take a weekend; I’ll fly you to Portland. Keep love alive. Coulson peels off from Tony, who is heading over to Thor. Means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. (to Thor) No hard feelings point break, you got a mean swing. Thor gives Tony a look as he walks to the control panels. TONY Also, means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 55. (to SHIELD personnel) Ah, raise the mizzen mast, ship the topsails. The personnel look at him strangely. That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did. Standing now at the command area of the ship, Tony covers one eye. (to Hill) How does Fury even see these? MARIA HILL (attitude) He turns! TONY Sounds exhausting! He begins messing with the screens, sticking something to the underside of a desk. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source- of high energy density. Something to- kick start the Cube. MARIA HILL When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics? TONY Last night. The packet, Selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers- am I the only one who did the reading? STEVE Does Loki need any particular kind of power source? BANNER He’s have to heat the Cube to a hundred and twenty million kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier. TONY Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the Quantum Tunneling effect. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 56. BANNER Well, if he could do that he could achieve heavy-ion fusion at any reactor on the planet. TONY Finally. Someone who speaks English. STEVE (to the others) Is that what just happened? Stark and Banner shake hands. TONY It’s good to meet you, Doctor Banner. Your work on anti-electronic collisions is unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of the way you- lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. BANNER ...Thanks. Fury enters. FURY Doctor Banner is only here to track the Cube. I was hoping you might join him. STEVE I’d start with that stick of his. It may be magical but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon. FURY I don’t know about that, but it is powered by the Cube. And I like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. THOR Monkeys? I do not understand- STEVE I do! The entire room goes instantly silent, staring at Steve. (MORE) (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (5) 57. STEVE (CONT’D) I...I understood that reference. TONY Shall we play, Doctor? BANNER This way, sir. The two men walk off. ON A SHIELD WORKER: He resumes play Galaga again. 81 INT. WISHBONE LAB, CARRIER - NIGHT 81 Banner and Stark are working on tracking the Cube. Banner is scanning the scepter with a device. BANNER The Gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig’s reports on the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take weeks to process. Stark works on a screen. TONY If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster we can clock this at around six hundred teraflops. BANNER All I packed was a toothbrush. TONY (giggles a bit) You know, you should come by Stark Tower some time. Top ten floors- all R and D. You’d love it, it’s a candy land. BANNER Thanks but...last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem. TONY Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension, no surprises. He zaps Banner in the side. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 58. BANNER Ow! STEVE Hey! TONY Nothing? Steve approaches. STEVE Are you nuts? TONY Jury’s out! (to Banner) You really have got a lid on it, haven’t you? What’s your secret? Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed? STEVE Is everything a joke to you? TONY Funny things are. STEVE Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn’t funny. No offense, Doc. BANNER No it’s alright. I wouldn’t have come aboard if I couldn’t handle pointy things. TONY You’re tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut. STEVE And you need to focus on the problem, Mister Stark. TONY You think I’m not? Why did Fury call us in? Why now, why not before? What isn’t he telling us? I can’t do the equation unless I have all the variables. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 59. STEVE You think Fury’s hiding something? TONY He’s a spy. Captain, he’s the spy. His secrets have secrets. He gestures to Banner. It’s bugging him to, isn’t it? BANNER Uh, Aah, I just wanna finish my work here and- STEVE Doctor? BANNER A warm light for all mankind,\" Loki’s jab at Fury about the Cube. STEVE I heard it. BANNER Well, I think that was meant for you. He gestures to Stark, who offers him a blueberry. Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news. STEVE The Stark Tower? That big ugly- Stark gives him a look. -building in New York? BANNER It’s powered by an arc reactor, self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for, what, a year? TONY It’s just the prototype. (to Rodgers) I’m kind of the only name in clean energy right now, that’s what he’s getting at. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 60. BANNER So, why didn’t SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? What are they even doing in the energy business in the first place? TONY I should probably look into that as soon as my decryption program finishes breaking into all of SHIELD’s secure files. STEVE I’m sorry did you say- TONY JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours I’ll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. Blueberry? STEVE Yet you’re confused about why they didn’t want you around. TONY An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome. STEVE I think Loki’s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war and if we don’t stay focused he’ll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them. TONY Following’s not really my style. STEVE And you’re all about style, aren’t you? TONY Out of the people in this room, which one is \"A\" wearing a spangly outfit and \"B\" not of use? BANNER Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (5) 61. STEVE Just find the Cube. Cap exits the lab, pauses and turns, walking off in another direction. TONY That’s the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn’t have kept him on ice. BANNER Guy’s not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us. TONY What he’s got is an ACME dynamite kit. It’s gonna blow up in his face, and I’m gonna be there when it does. BANNER I’ll read all about it. TONY Mhm, or, you’ll be suiting up with the rest of us. BANNER Now, you see I don’t get a suit of armor. I’m exposed, like a nerve, it’s a nightmare. TONY You know, I’ve got a cluster shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it- He taps the arc reactor. -this little circle of light. It’s part of me now, not just armor. It’s a terrible privilege. BANNER But you can control it. TONY Because I learned how. BANNER It’s different. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (6) 62. Tony wipes clean the screen between them that Banner was working on. TONY Hey, I read all about your accident. That much Gamma exposure- should’ve killed you. BANNER So you’re saying that the Hulk- the Other Guy- saved my life? That’s nice. That’s nice sentiment. Saved it for- what? TONY I guess we’ll find out. BANNER You may not enjoy that. TONY And you just might. 82 INT. STORAGE ROOM, CARRIER - EARLY DAWN 82 Cap forces open the entrance to a storage room. He walks in, looking around then silently jumps up to a catwalk above. 83 EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 83 A truck drive along. It drives into a tunnel 84 INT.

BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 85 Coulson is showing Thor an image of Jane Foster on a computer screen. AGENT COULSON ...moved Jane Foster. We’ve got an excellent observatory in Tromsø. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She’ll be safe. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 63. THOR Thank you. It’s no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he’s done. Erik is a good man. Coulson and Thor begins walking, through the bridge. AGENT COULSON He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here. THOR They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we’re more advanced, but we- we come here battling like Bildschneip. AGENT COULSON Like what? THOR Bildschneip. You know, huge, scaly, big antlers. You don’t have those? AGENT COULSON No. THOR Huh! Well they are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path. Thor moves over to a large window. When I first came to earth, Loki’s rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. FURY War hasn’t started yet. You think you can make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is? THOR I do not know. Loki’s mind is far afield, it’s not just power he craves, it’s vengeance upon me. There’s no pain would prise his need from him. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 64. FURY A lot of guys think that, until the pain starts. THOR What are you asking me to do? FURY I’m asking, what are you prepared to do? THOR Loki is a prisoner. FURY Then why do I feel like he’s the only person on this boat that wants to be here? 86 INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - DAWN 86 Loki is pacing in the cell. Natasha walks up behind him. LOKI Hm. There’s not many people that can sneak up on me. NATASHA But you figured I’d come. LOKI After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate. NATASHA I wanna know what you’ve done to Agent Barton. LOKI I’d say I’ve expanded his mind. NATASHA And once you’ve won. Once you’re king of the mountain. What happens to his mind? LOKI Is this love, Agent Romanoff? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 65. NATASHA Love is for children. I owe him a debt. LOKI Tell me. NATASHA Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh- well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skill set. I didn’t care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD’s radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call. LOKI And what will you do if I vow to spare him? NATASHA Not let you out. LOKI Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man? NATASHA Regime’s fall everyday. I tend not to weep over that, I’m Russian, or I was. LOKI And what are you now? NATASHA It’s really not that complicated. I got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out. LOKI Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? Drakov’s daughter? Sao Paulo? The hospital fire? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it’s gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child, a prayer. Pathetic66. 87 INT. WISHBONE LAB, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS (DAWN) 87 Banner and Tony stare at a screen that reads \"ACCESS DENIED\" Tony tries to hack in again. LOKI (V.O) ...You lie and kill in the service of liars... 88 INT. BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 88 Hill runs over to a SHIELD Agent’s computer. A message flashes up on the screen \"VIRUS DETECTED\" as a result of Stark hacking their files. Fury walks over and Hill, who looks up at him. LOKI (V.O) ...and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code... 89 INT. STORAGE ROOM, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 89 Cap opens a container and in it is HYDRA weapons and equipment. LOKI (V.O) ...something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away. 90 INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 90 Loki slams his fist against the glass. Natasha jumps back. LOKI I won’t touch Barton! Not until I make him kill you.

NATASHA (into earpiece) Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I’m on my way. Send Thor as well. She stops and faces Loki. Thank you, for your cooperation! Natasha skimmers off. 91 INT. WISHBONE LAB, CARRIER - MORNING 91 Fury enters. FURY What are you doing, Mr. Stark? TONY Uh- kind of been wondering the same thing about you.

THOR My people want nothing but peace with your planet. FURY But you’re not the only people out there, are you? And, you’re not the only threat. The world’s filling up with people who can’t be matched, they can’t be controlled. STEVE Like you controlled the cube! THOR Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for A HIGHER FORM OF WAR. STEVE A higher form?! FURY You forced our hand! We had to come up with some- TONY Nuclear deterrent! ’Cause that always calms everything right down. Everyone becomes hostile and begin cutting each other off. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 70.

STEVE I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. I’ve seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you. TONY I think I would just cut the wire. STEVE Always a way out. You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero. TONY A hero, like you? You’re a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm? Everyone is watching Banner, Fury and Natasha reach for their guns. STEVE Doctor Banner, put down the scepter. Banner looks down, surprised, to see the spear in his hand.

His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat. Banner begins to transform into the Hulk, shirt tearing, he throws himself away from Romanoff, who looks terrified, then he turns to look at her, transforming -- just as the lights go out. NATASHA Bruce. The transformation completes and Banner’s alter ego, the Hulk, gets unsteadily to his feet, and roars.

He shoots another arrow, which she dodges by dropping across to the next passage. Barton follows her. They fight along that catwalk. The fight is very even.

Coulson suddenly appears, wielding a large prototype Phase Two weapon. AGENT COULSON Move away please. Loki steps back from the panel. Coulson gestures to the gun. Do you like this? We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer. Even I don’t know what it does. Do you wanna find out? Coulson prepares to fire the weapon when Loki disappears, reappearing behind him and thrusting the point of his spear through Coulson’s chest. He yells and drops to the floor. THOR NO! Loki returns to the panel, opening the chute and pressing the button which sends the cell, and Thor, falling from the ship. 132 INT.

I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Think I had that coming. Fury begins to make his way around the table to Steve and Tony. Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number, though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative. Fury reaches a chair between Tony and Steve The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes. Tony stands and walks out. Well, it’s an old fashioned notion.91. 145 EXT. REMOTE FIELD - DAY 145 Thor is making his way over to Mjolnir. He hesitates to pick it up, fearing he is not worthy. He clenches his fist. 146 INT.

BANNER Stark Tower. I- no. The Security Guard looks at him. Yes. SECURITY GUARD I’d expect some confusion of the mind, since your body’s kind of all over the place, but it has to be one or the other. The Security Guard gestures Banner to follow him. BANNER I know where I could do the most good, but it’s where I can do the most harm. SECURITY GUARD Well, that’s no different than anybody else. They walk out the doors. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 93. Me? I’m here is Jersey where I can’t do much of either.

(CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 94. BARTON Thanks. Natasha begins to remove the strap restraints. Natasha, how many agents? NATASHA Don’t. Don’t do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki.

He’s gonna make his play soon though. Today. Natasha walks to the door. NATASHA We gotta stop him. BARTON Yeah? Who’s we? NATASHA I don’t know. Whoever is left.

TONY For taking on Loki alone. STEVE He was doing his job. TONY He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have- STEVE Sometimes there isn’t a way out, Tony. TONY Right. How did that work for him? STEVE Is this the first time you’ve lost a soldier? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 96. TONY We are not soldiers! I’m not marching to Fury’s fife. STEVE Neither am I. He’s got the same blood on his hands that Loki does, but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list- Tony looks down at the place Coulson fell, there is a dent in the wall. TONY He made it personal. STEVE That’s not the point. TONY That is the point. That’s Loki’s point. He hit us all right where we live. Why? STEVE To tear us apart. TONY Yeah, divide and conquer is great but- he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That’s what he wants. He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience. STEVE Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart. TONY Yeah. That’s just previews, this is- this is opening night. And Loki, he’s a full-tail diva.

A new universe. IRON MAN (annoyed) Okay. He fires at the barrier around the device, but the Tesseract deflects it, sending the energy outwards, knocking Selvig out and Iron Man back. JARVIS The barrier is pure energy. It’s unbreachable. IRON MAN Yeah, I got that. Iron Man looks down to see Loki on the platform outside the penthouse. I’m beat.

Loki turns away and Tony slips a pair of bracelets onto his wrists. A super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you’ve managed to piss off every single one of them. LOKI That was the plan. Tony begins to walk to the center of the penthouse where Loki is. TONY Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they’ll come for you. LOKI I have an army. TONY We have a Hulk. LOKI Oh, I thought the beast had wandered off. TONY Yeah- you’re missing the point. There’s no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it’s too much for us, but it’s all on you. ’Cause if we can’t protect the earth, you can be damned well sure we’ll avenge it. Loki walks over to Tony, pointing his scepter. LOKI How will your friends have time for me, when they’re so busy fighting you? Loki walks up to Tony, and places the tip of the scepter over his heart. It clinks against the arc reactor. This usually works. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 102. TONY Well, performance issues. You know? Loki grabs Tony by the throat and throws him across the room.

UNKNOWN AREA OF SPACE 1 Space, a floating staircase among the rocks...THE OTHER speaks to a DISEMBODIED FIGURE in a chair. THE OTHER (V.O) The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world, a human world. They would wield its power. THE OTHER hands LOKI a scepter with a glowing blue gem... THE OTHER (V.O) But our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force... The CHITAURI put on their face mask and get ready. THE OTHER (V.O) ...our Chitauri, will follow. The world will be his...the universe, yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn? A 3d model of the Tesseract, we move inside it slowly 2 EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - EARLY NIGHT 2 A helicopter SPEEDS over this mountain at high-speed. The CAMERA pans up over the mountain and we see... 3 EXT. SHIELD/NASA FACILITY - CONTINUOUS 3 This base is grand beyond belief. There is a frantic evacuation in progress.

The sign on the building reads: JOINT DARK ENERGY MISSION; WESTERN DIVISION; PROJECT PEGASUS, NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, S.H.I.E.L.D ACCELERATOR TEST FACILITY INTERCOM VOICE ...for all campus evacuation. Security Guards direct traffic. SHIELD agents assist people, some stuff the trunks of their cars and leave the campus. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 2. INTERCOM VOICE (CONT’D) This is not a drill.

AGENT COULSON Campus should be clear in the next half hour. FURY Do better. Fury and Hill continue on as Coulson turns around and heads the other way. 7 INT. STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER (EARLY NIGHT) 7 Fury and Hill make their way down to the lower levels. MARIA HILL Sir, evacuation may be futile. FURY We should tell them to go back to sleep? MARIA HILL If we can’t control the Tesseract’s energy there may not be a minimum safe distance. FURY I need you to make sure the Phase Two prototypes are shipped out. MARIA HILL Sir, is that really a priority right now? FURY Until such time as the world ends we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of Phase Two on a truck and gone. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 4. MARIA HILL Yes, Sir. (to guards) With me. Fury enters the Tesseract room. 8 INT. TESSERACT CHAMBER ROOM - CONTINUOUS (EARLY NIGHT) 8 Fury makes his way over to ERIK SELVIG. FURY Talk to me, Doctor. SELVIG Director. FURY Is there anything we know for certain? SELVIG The Tesseract is misbehaving. FURY Is that supposed to be funny? SELVIG No, it’s not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she’s misbehaving. FURY How soon can you pull the plug? SELVIG She’s an energy source. We turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level- FURY We prepared for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space. SELVIG We don’t have the harness. My calculations are far from complete. She’s throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of Gamma radiation. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 5. FURY That can be harmful. Where’s agent Barton? SELVIG The hawk? Up in his nest, as usual. CLINT BARTON, also known as HAWKEYE, is on a balcony, observing the lab. FURY (over Barton’s radio) Agent Barton. Report. Barton zip-lines down a rope. FURY (V.O) (sturn) I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things. Fury and Barton walk together toward the Tesseract machine. BARTON I see better from a distance. FURY Have you seen anything that might set this thing off? A NASA SCIENTIST calls for Selvig. NASA SCIENTIST Doctor! It’s spiking again. Barton and Fury step onto the platform, in front of the Tesseract machine. BARTON No one’s come and gone. And Selvig’s clean. No contacts, no IM. If there’s any tampering, sir, it wasn’t this end. While Barton is talking Selvig walks over to the computer where the NASA SCIENTIST is. He looks concerned and worried. FURY (a little confused) At this end? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 6. BARTON Yeah. The Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? Doors open from both sides. The Cube sparks. SELVIG What’s that? It sparks again. 9 EXT. BEHIND A TRUCK - SAME (EARLY NIGHT) 9 Coulson stands. The grounds of the campus shakes. He grabs the truck. 10 INT. SECURITY LEVEL FOUR - SAME 10 Hill turns and looks around her, hearing a creaking noise as the building shakes. 11 INT. TESSERACT CHAMBER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 11 The Cube sparks some more, bigger each time. A beam of energy which opens into a portal. There is an explosion. A could from the beam floats to the top of the chamber. On the platform is LOKI, God of Mischief and Lies, kneeling. Several GUARDS move in slowly. TIGHT ON LOKI: He looks up, grinning menacingly. She stands. DOLLY IN: Fury and Barton stare in shock. ON SELVIG: He is in awe and horror. Loki looks around. Fury is ready to act. FURY (to Loki) Sir, please put down the spear! Loki looks at his scepter then fires a stream on blue light from it. Barton pushes Fury out the way. The guards open fire. Loki jumps at them, firing more energy and fighting. Shooting scientists and agents. Barton moves towards him but Loki grabs his arm. LOKI You have heart. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 7. Loki touches the tip of the spear to Barton’s chest and his eyes become ice blue. He puts his gun away. Loki moves to another agent and does the same as he’s done to Barton. Fury pulls the Cube from the machine it was in and shuts it in a briefcase, then moves to leave. LOKI (to Fury, turning around) Please don’t. I still need that. FURY This doesn’t have to get any messier. LOKI Of course it does. I’ve come too far for anything else. I am Loki, of Asgard. And I am burdened with glorious purpose. Selvig, checking the pulse of NASA SCIENTIST, hears and approaches. SELVIG Loki, brother of Thor? FURY We have no quarrel with your people. LOKI An ant has no quarrel with a boot. FURY You planning to step on us? LOKI I come with glad tidings, of a world made free. FURY Free from what? LOKI Freedom. Freedom is life’s great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart- Loki turns and places the spear tip on Selvig’s chest. -you will know peace. Barton sees the Tesseract portal cloud, brewing and moves to Loki. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 8. FURY Yeah, you say peace. I kinda think you mean the other thing. BARTON (to Loki) Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow and drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us. FURY Like the pharaohs of old. SELVIG He’s right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. We’ve got maybe two minutes before this goes critical. LOKI Well then. Barton quickly draws his gun and shoots Fury, who drops the case. Barton picks up as he, Loki, Selvig and another agent leave the room. 12 INT. SECURITY LEVEL FOUR - A FEW SHORT MOMENTS LATER 12 Barton and the others walk under the closing gate. Hill comes out from the back room. BARTON We need this vehicles. MARIA HILL (seeing Loki) Who’s that? BARTON Didn’t tell me. The roof is slowly crumbling. Loki gets onto a SHIELD pickup truck.

Barton enters the driver’s seat of the pickup and drives off with Loki is in the bed. 15 INT. TESSERACT CHAMBER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 15 Fury stands up and rushes out as the Tesseract cloud gets bigger and bigger above him. The lab is getting destroyed. FURY (into radio) Get the Tesseract. Shut them down. 16 INT. SECURITY LEVEL FOUR - CONTINUOUS 16 Hill throws her radio into the front seat of a SHIELD jeep. She jumps in after and speeds away, trying to catch up with Barton. 17 INT. DIMLY LIT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 17 SHIELD cars are chasing Barton’s pickup. Loki fires a beam from his spear, flipping the car over on its head -- blocking the pursuing vehicles and fleeing cars. 18 INT. LOWER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS (EARLY DAWN) 18 The portal begins to collapse as Fury tries to escape. Falling debris misses him by a few inches. 19 INT. FRONT STEPS OF A BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 19 Coulson is assisting evacuation, supervising guards as the wheel crates. An explosion rocks the building. They all fall as the roof dissolves faster.

DIMLY LIT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 20 Barton speeds up because he’s coming up on an intersection.

TESSERACT CHAMBER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 25 The Tesseract portal cloud explodes. 26 EXT. SHIELD/NASA FACILITY - CONTINUOUS 26 The entire base explodes and crumbles in on itself -- sinking into the underground. Fury watches in horror from his chopper window.11. 27 DIMLY LIT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 27 The ceiling of the tunnel falls, trapping Hill and other agents underground. Loki looks at the exit to see if they will make it out. 28 INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCK - CONTINUOUS 28 Coulson and the others in the canopy stare at the ground behind their truck -- the ground is still collapsing, seconds behind there vehicle, they get away in time. 29 EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 29 Loki and the others escape the tunnel seconds before the exit is covered up by the fallen ceiling. As they drive along, Fury’s chopper chases them. Barton drives frantically as Fury shoots at them from the sky. Loki blasts the helicopter and Fury jumps to the ground as it crashes, he continues to fire as the truck drives off in the distance. He stands. AGENT COULSON (over Fury’s radio) Director. BEGIN INTERCUT: FURY / TRUCK CANOPY / UNDERGROUND TUNNEL AGENT COULSON (CONT’D) (into radio) Director Fury, do you copy? FURY (into radio) The Tesseract is with a hostile force. I have men down. Hill? MARIA HILL (into radio; getting out of crushed jeep) A lot of men still under. Don’t know how many survivors. FURY (over Hill’s radio) Sound a general call. I want every living soul... FURY (into radio) ...not working rescue looking for that briefcase. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 12. MARIA HILL (into radio) Roger that. FURY (into radio) Coulson, get back to base. FURY (over Coulson’s radio) This is a level seven. FURY (over Hill’s radio) As of right now... FURY (into his radio) We are at war. AGENT COULSON (into his radio) What do we do? Fury thinks, as the CAMERA GOES TIGHT on him. TITLE CARD: Marvel’s THE AVENGERS 30 EXT. OLD WAREHOUSE, RUSSIA - NIGHT 30 A train speeds by. CAMERA PULLS through the warehouse window and MOVES UP to the third floor where NATASHA ROMANOFF aka BLACK WIDOW, is tied to a chair. A man slaps her. She screams. GEORGI LUCHKOV (in Russian) This isn’t how I wanted this evening to go. NATASHA (in Russian) I know how you wanted this evening. Believe me this is better. GEORGI LUCHKOV (in Russian) Who are you working for? Lermentov, yes? TALL THUG walks over to Natasha and leans the chair over a pit. She becomes scared. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 13. GEORGI LUCHKOV (CONT’D) (in Russian) Does he think we have to go through him to move our cargo? NATASHA (in Russian) I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business. GEORGI LUCHKOV (in Russian) Solohob. A bagman, a front. Your outdated information betrays you. The famous Black Widow is just another pretty face. NATASHA (in Russian) You really think I’m pretty? TALL THUG grabs her jaw and forces it open as Luchkov walks to the table behind him. GEORGI LUCHKOV (in Russian) Tell Lermentov we don’t need him to move the tanks. Tell him he is out. Well... Luchkov picks up a tool of the table and plays with it. ...You may have to write it. Suddenly a phone rings. WEASELLY THUG answers his phone. WEASELLY THUG It’s for her. Luchkov takes the phone. GEORGI LUCHKOV (in Russian; into cell) You listen carefully- AGENT COULSON (V.O) (over the cell) You’re at 1- 14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out. Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 14. Luchkov hands the phone to Natasha, who balances it on her shoulder. (over the cell) We need you to come in. NATASHA (into cell) Are you kidding? I’m working. AGENT COULSON (over the cell) This takes precedence. NATASHA (into cell) I’m in the middle of an interrogation, and this moron is giving me everything. GEORGI LUCHKOV (to Tall Thug) I not- give everything. Natasha gives Luchkov a look. BEGIN INTERCUT: COULSON / NATASHA NATASHA (into cell) Look, you can’t pull me out of this right now. AGENT COULSON (into cell) Natasha...Barton’s been compromised. NATASHA (into cell) Let me put you on hold. Luchkov moves in for the cell phone. Natasha kicks him between the legs and headbutts him. WEASELLY THUG swings his fist at her and she kicks him back. TALL THUG runs up and she spins around -- and the chair legs hit him. WEASELLY THUG jumps to his feet. Natasha rolls with the chair and drops the legs on his feet. She whips her head at him and hits him in the nose then trips him. As she fights the TALL THUG, Coulson listens to the fight over the phone. He stands quiet -- waiting as he hears the groaning, kicking, and punching. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 15. Natasha spring boards off TALL THUG’s back, somersaults, and breaks the chair on WEASELLY THUG. TALL THUG grabs her and Natasha bends his hand then hits him with the chair leg. She does a front dropkick against TALL THUG then pushes herself off the ground with both hands. She runs toward TALL THUG, who is out of breath, and flips him with her thighs. Luchkov stands and she swiftly walks over to the chain hanging from the ceiling. As he approaches she hits him with it, wraps one leg in it, and throws him into the pit. She leaves him upside down and picks up the cell and her high heels. NATASHA (CONT’D) (into cell) Where’s Barton now? AGENT COULSON (over cell) We don’t know. NATASHA But he’s alive? AGENT COULSON (into phone) We think so. Coulson is looking at a screen that’s playing a video of Hawkeye & Black Widow in Budapest. We’ll brief you on everything when you get back. Coulson is handed a folder. He walks down some stairs as he talks. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy. NATASHA (into cell) Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me. AGENT COULSON Oh I’ve got Stark! You get the big guy. END INTERCUT Natasha stops in her tracks, shocked at what Coulson has just said. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (5) 16. NATASHA (in Russian; quietly) My God. 31 EXT. SLUMS, CALCUTTA, INDIA - NIGHT 31 A YOUNG GIRL sprints across a busy street. She runs through a crowd of people, rushing down an busy alleyway. She runs into a house and up the stairs. CALCUTTA WOMAN approaches her. BRUCE BANNER, the alter ego of the Incredible Hulk, is treating the ill in the b.g. CALCUTTA WOMAN (in Hindi) Who are you? Get out! There is sickness here! YOUNG GIRL (very fast in Hindi) Are you the doctor? I need a doctor. My father. My father’s not waking up! He has a fever and he’s moaning but his eyes won’t open. Banner hears and moves over to the YOUNG GIRL. He kneels before her. BANNER (in Hindi) Slow down. YOUNG GIRL (in Hindi) My father- BANNER (in Hindi) Like them? Banner points to the people in the house that are sick. YOUNG GIRL nods and holds up a wad of cash. YOUNG GIRL (in Hindi; emotion) Please!17. 32 EXT. OLD ABANDONED SHACK, CALCUTTA OUTSKIRTS - LATER 32 YOUNG GIRL is rushing to reach the shack but Banner, a little suspicious, grabs her -- slowing her down. A truck drives by very slow, Banner glances at it as it passes. Banner and the girl rush across the dirt road. The YOUNG GIRL sprints into the shack and Banner follows slowly. 33 INT. OLD ABANDONED SHACK - CONTINUOUS 33 Banner enters in time to see her escape through the window. He’s been ditched and he realizes he’s been set up. BANNER (quietly to himself) Should have got paid upfront Banner. NATASHA You know, for a man who’s supposed to be... Natasha reveals herself to Banner from behind a curtain. NATASHA (CONT’D) ...avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. BANNER (putting his bag down) Avoiding stress isn’t the secret. NATASHA Then what is it? Yoga? BANNER And you brought me to the end of the city. Smart. (peeping through the window) I- uh- I assume the whole place is surrounded. Natasha removes her scarf. NATASHA Just you and me. BANNER And your actress buddy? She a spy too, they start that wrong? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 18. NATASHA (a little nervous) I did. BANNER Who are you? NATASHA Natasha Romanoff. BANNER Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff? ’Cause that’s not going to work out for everyone. NATASHA No, no. Of course not. I’m here on behalf of SHIELD. BANNER (a little mad) SHIELD. How’d they find me? NATASHA We never lost you, Doctor. We’ve kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent. BANNER Why? NATASHA Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now we need you to come in. BANNER What if I say no? NATASHA (seductive, sturn, smiling) I’ll persuade you. BANNER (a little sad and reluctant) And what if the- Other Guy says no? NATASHA You’ve been more than a year without an incident. I don’t think you want to break that streak. Banner pushes at an old wooden cradle, it creaks. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 19. BANNER Well, I don’t every time get what I want. NATASHA Doctor, we’re facing a potential global catastrophe. BANNER (chuckles) Oh those I actively try to avoid. NATASHA This (takes a seat) is the Tesseract. Natasha slides a cell phone along the table. On it is an image of the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet. Banner puts on his glasses, approaches and picks up the touch screen cell phone. BANNER What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it? NATASHA He wants you to find it. It’s been taken. It emits a Gamma signature that’s too weak for us to trace. No one knows Gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that’s where I’d be. BANNER So Fury isn’t after the monster? NATASHA Not that he’s told me. BANNER And he tells you everything? NATASHA Talk to Fury, he needs you on this. BANNER (immediate response) He needs me in a cage? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 20. NATASHA No one’s going to put you in a- BANNER STOP LYING TO ME! Banner yells, crashing his hands down on the table. Natasha stands, pulling a gun and aims at him. He draws back, smiling. I’m sorry. That was mean. (smiles) I just wanted to see what you’d do. Natasha stares at him, a little teary, scared out of her mind. Why don’t we do this the easy way where you don’t use that and the- Other Guy doesn’t make a mess? Okay?....Natasha. Natasha lowers her weapon and speaks into an earpiece. NATASHA (quietly into her earpiece) Stand down. We’re good here. The horde of armed guards surrounding the shack lower their weapons. BANNER Just you and me? Natasha realizes he knows and stands silent. 34 INT. DARK ROOM, CARRIER - NIGHT 34 Fury is talking with the Council, four shadowy figures on screens. COUNCILMAN This is out of line, Director. You’re dealing with forces you can’t control. FURY You ever been in a war, councilman? In a fire fight? Did you feel an over abundance of control? COUNCILMAN You’re saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 21. FURY Not Asgard, Loki. COUNCILWOMAN He can’t be working alone. What about the other one, his brother? FURY Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile. But he’s worlds away and we can’t depend on him to help either. It’s up to us. COUNCILMAN Which is why you should be focusing on Phase Two, it was designed for exactly this purpose. FURY Phase Two isn’t ready; our enemy is. We need a response team. COUNCILMAN The Avengers Initiative was shut down. FURY This isn’t about the Avengers. COUNCILMAN We’re running the world’s greatest covert security network and you’re gonna leave the fate of the human race to a handful of freaks. FURY I’m not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people may be isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe, with the right push, they can be exactly what we need. COUNCILWOMAN You believe! COUNCILMAN War isn’t won by sentiment, Director. FURY No, It’s won by soldiers.22. 35 INT. GYM - NIGHT 35 STEVE ROGERS, alter ego of Captain America, is hitting a punching bag in a gym. He has several flashbacks of World War Two. During his flashbacks... CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O) There’s not enough time. I gotta put her in the water. ...he hits the bag harder, faster... PEGGY CARTER (V.O) You won’t be alone. ...he hits the bag even faster. SCIENTIST (V.O) Oh my God. This guy’s still alive. Steve throws the hardest punch he has left and it knocks the bag across the room. Breathing hard, Steve picks up another bag from a line on the floor and hangs it up. He begins to hit it. And- FURY (across the room) Trouble sleeping? STEVE (hitting the bag) Slept for seventy years, Sir. I think I’ve had my fill. Fury slowly approaches Steve. FURY Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. STEVE When I went under, the world was at war. I wake up- they say we won. They didn’t say what we lost. FURY We’ve made some mistakes along the way, some very recently. STEVE (removing hand wrap) You here with a mission, Sir? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 23. FURY I am. STEVE (removing other hand wrap) Trying to get me back in the world? FURY Trying to save it. Fury hands Steve a folder with information on the Tesseract in it. STEVE HYDRA’s secret weapon. FURY Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think. The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That’s something the world sorely needs. STEVE Who took it from you? FURY He’s called Loki. He’s- not from around here. There’s a lot we’ll have to bring you up to speed on if you’re in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know. STEVE At this point I doubt anything would surprise me. Steve gets up, grabs his duffel bag, and another punching bag while Fury is talking. FURY Ten bucks says you’re wrong. There’s a debriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 24. STEVE You should have left it in the ocean. Steve exits. 36 EXT. OCEAN, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT 36 IRON MAN aka Tony Stark, is underwater. He attaches a device to a massive pipe. He flies up out of the water and towards the city and begins talking with PEPPER POTTS. IRON MAN Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you. PEPPER (V.O) (over Iron Man headset) You disconnected the transmission lines? Are we off the grid? INSIDE IRON MAN HEADSET: TONY (into headset) Stark Tower’s about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy. PEPPER (on Iron Man HUD display) Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over and it actually works. 37 EXT. STREETS OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - CONTINUOUS 37 Iron Man peels around a corner, heading straight for STARK TOWER. TONY (V.O) I assume. Light her up. Stark Tower lights up. PEPPER (V.O) (over Iron Man headset) How does it look?25. 38 EXT. STARK TOWER - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 38 TONY (V.O) (over Iron Man headset) Like Christmas... INSIDE IRON MAN HEADSET: TONY (into headset) ...but with more- me. PEPPER (on Iron Man HUD display) We’ve got to go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. Iron Man flies over a overpass & up the side of Stark Tower. PEPPER (V.O) (over Iron Man headset) I’m in DC tomorrow. I’m working on the zoning for the next three buildings. TONY (V.O) (over Iron Man headset) Pepper, you’re killing me at the moment. Remember, enjoy the moment. 39 EXT. STARK TOWER LANDING PAD - CONTINUOUS 39 PEPPER (V.O) (over Iron Man headset) Then get in here and I will. Iron Man lands on the landing pad of the tower and walks along a walkway, robotic arms deconstructing his armor. JARVIS Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line. TONY I’m not in. I’m actually out. JARVIS Sir, I’m afraid he’s insisting. TONY Grow a spine, JARVIS. I got a date.26. 40 INT. PENTHOUSE, STARK TOWER - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 40 Pepper stands in front of a holographic display, a little confused. PEPPER Levels are holding steady- I think. Tony approaches Pepper. TONY Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which leads me to my next question. How does it feel to be a genius? Tony turns off the display and Pepper and he face each other. PEPPER Well, ah, I really wouldn’t know now would I? TONY What do you mean? All this came from you. PEPPER No, all this came from that. Pepper taps Tony’s arc reactor. TONY Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself- twelve percent of the credit. PEPPER Twelve percent?TONY An argument can be made for fifteen. Pepper walks toward the living room. PEPPER Twelve percent of my baby? TONY (following Pepper) Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things and sorry but, the security snafu? That was on you. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 27. PEPPER Oh! TONY My private elevator. Pepper pours champagne in two glasses. PEPPER You mean our elevator. TONY Yeah, it was teeming with sweaty workmen. I’m going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later aren’t I? PEPPER Not gonna be that subtle. TONY I’ll tell you what, next building is gonna say ’Potts’ on the tower. PEPPER On the lease! TONY Call your mum, can you bunk over? JARVIS Sir, the telephone. I’m afraid my protocols are being overridden. TONY Ah- Tony picks up his high-tech phone and holds up. AGENT COULSON (on phone screen) Mr. Stark, we need to talk. TONY You have reached the Life Model Decoy of Tony Stark. Please leave a message. AGENT COULSON (on phone screen) This is urgent. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 28. TONY Then leave it urgently. The elevator opens and Coulson comes out. Security breach. (to Pepper) That’s on you! PEPPER Phil! Come in! Pepper and Tony walk over to Coulson, who is entering TONY Phil? AGENT COULSON I can’t stay. TONY Uh, his first name is Agent. PEPPER Come on in, we’re celebrating. TONY (fake smiling) Which is why he can’t stay. AGENT COULSON (handing Tony the laptop) We need you to look this over, as soon as possible. Tony stares at the laptop. TONY I don’t like being handed things. PEPPER That’s fine because I love to be handed things. So, let’s trade. Pepper swaps with Coulson -- he has with her glass and she has the laptop. She then takes Tony’s glass and passes the laptop on to him. Thank you. TONY Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 29. AGENT COULSON This isn’t a consultation. PEPPER Is this about the Avengers? Coulson looks at Pepper Which I know nothing about. TONY The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought, and I didn’t even qualify. PEPPER I didn’t know that either. TONY Yeah, apparently I’m volatile, self-obsessed, don’t play well with others. PEPPER That I did know. AGENT COULSON This isn’t about personality profiles anymore. TONY Whatever! Ms. Potts, got a sec? PEPPER Half a moment. Pepper leaves Coulson at the door and goes over to Tony. TONY You know, I thought we were having a moment. PEPPER I was having twelve percent of a moment. Tony gives Pepper a look. This seems serious. Phil looks pretty shaken. TONY How would you notice- why is he Phil? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (5) 30. PEPPER What is all this? TONY This is- ah... Tony grabs the holograms on the laptop and throws them up. Holograms fill the room, each is a article on one of the Avengers. ...this! They both look upon the screens, observing them. PEPPER I’m going to take the jet to DC tonight. TONY Tomorrow. PEPPER You have homework. You have a lot of homework. TONY Well, what if I didn’t? PEPPER If you didn’t? You mean when you finished? Well, um, then- She leans in and whispers in Tony’s ear. TONY Square deal. Fly safe. They kiss. Coulson looks away. PEPPER Work hard. (approaching Coulson) So, any chance you’re driving by LaGuardia? AGENT COULSON I can drop you off. PEPPER (O.S) Fantastic. Ooh, I want to hear about the ah- cellist, is that still a thing? As they are talking, Tony sees the Tesseract -- It peaks his interest. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (6) 31. AGENT COULSON (O.S) She moved back to Portland. Pepper and Coulson board the elevator. PEPPER What?...Boo. 41 EXT. OCEAN - DAY 41 A jet flies over the sea at high-speed. 42 INT. JET - CONTINUOUS 42 Steve is watching a video of the Hulk. FACELESS PILOT (to Coulson) We’re about forty minutes out from home base, Sir. Coulson stands from a chair and walks over to Steve. STEVE So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me? AGENT COULSON A lot of people were. You were the world’s first superhero. Banner thought Gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine’s original formula. STEVE Didn’t really go his way, did it? AGENT COULSON Not so much. When he’s not that thing though, guy’s like a Stephen Hawking. Rogers looks confused. He’s like a- smart person. I gotta say- it’s an honor to meet you, officially. I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. I mean, I was, I was present, while you were unconscious from-the-ice. Steve moves over to the cockpit and Coulson follows (MORE) (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 32. AGENT COULSON (CONT’D) You know it’s really- it’s just a- just a huge honor to have you on board- it’s... STEVE Well, I hope I’m the man for the job. AGENT COULSON Oh you are, absolutely. Ah- we made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input. STEVE The uniform? Aren’t the stars and stripes a little...old-fashioned? AGENT COULSON Everything that’s happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old-fashioned. 43 INT. LOKI’S LIAR, UNDERGROUND LAB - DAY 43 Two soldiers run down a tunnel...we hear them coming. They run into the lab where dozens of men are working, including Selvig. Loki sits and watches, spear in hand. It glows and he is transported to another world. 44 EXT. SPACE (CONTINUOUS) 44 THE OTHER The Chitauri grow restless. LOKI Let them goad themselves. I will lead them in a glorious battle. THE OTHER Battle? Against the meager might of Earth. LOKI Glorious not lengthy- if your force is as formidable as you claim. THE OTHER You question us? You question him? He who out the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose? When you were cast out- defeated! (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 33. LOKI I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard, betrayed. THE OTHER Your ambition is little, full of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil. LOKI You don’t have the Tesseract yet. The Chitauri creature lunges at Loki, hissing. I don’t threaten. But until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words. THE OTHER You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice, where he cannot find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain. 45 INT. LOKI’S LIAR, UNDERGROUND LAB - CONTINUOUS 45 Loki comes back and he flinches. He stares, mad. 46 EXT. OCEAN - DAY 46 A jet flies to a giant carrier in the water, it’s the SHIELD HELICARRIER in all its glory. Personnel are walking all over, some are strapping down jets and containers. 47 EXT. HELICARRIER - DAY 47 A jet lands. Coulson and Steve step out of it. Natasha walks toward them. AGENT COULSON Agent Romanoff- Captain Rogers. STEVE Ma’am. NATASHA Hi. (to Coulson) They need you on the bridge; they’re starting the face trace. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 34. AGENT COULSON See you there. Coulson, leaves as Natasha and Steve get to know each other while walking. NATASHA It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. Thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? STEVE Trading cards? NATASHA They’re vintage. He’s very proud. They see Banner who is bumping into people while he observes the carrier. STEVE Doctor Banner. BANNER Oh, yeah, hi. They told me you’d be coming. STEVE Word is you can find the Cube. BANNER Is that the only word on me? STEVE Only word I care about. BANNER Must be strange for you, all of this. STEVE Well, this is actually kind of familiar. NATASHA Gentlemen, you might wanna step inside in a minute. It’s gonna get a little had to breathe. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 35. HELICARRIER INTERCOM Flight Mode. Secure the deck. There is a loud whirring and clunking sound and Banner and Rodgers make their way to the edge of the helicarrier. STEVE Is this a submarine? BANNER Really, they want me in a submerged pressurized metal container? Propellers begin to spin and the carrier begins to lift into the air. Oh no, this is much worse. The helicarrier begins ascending higher and higher. 48 INT. BRIDGE, CARRIER - MINUTES LATER 48 Rogers and Banner follow Natasha into the bridge. Natasha peels away from them as they stare and observe in awe. It’s very busy, with SHIELD personnel working at stations, and communicating over earpieces. CARRIER BRIDGE TECH 1 Maximum performance take off, increase output to capacity.FEMALE CARRIER BRIDGE TECH Power plant performing at capacity. We are clear. MARIA HILL All engines operating. SHIELD emergency protocol one nine three point six in effect. (to Fury) We’re at level, sir. FURY Good! Let’s vanish. MARIA HILL Engage retro reflection panels. 49 EXT.

BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 50 MALE AGENT (O.S) Reflection panels engaged. FURY (to Steve and Banner) Gentlemen. Steve slips Fury the ten dollars he bet earlier, in regards to nothing being able to surprise him. (to Banner) Doctor, thank you for coming. Banner shakes Fury’s hand. BANNER Thanks for asking nicely. So, um, how long am I staying? FURY Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you’re in the wind. BANNER Well where are you with that? AGENT COULSON We’re sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cell phones... Steve stands in the b.g. confused of what’s being said. While Coulson is talking, Natasha moves over to a computer screen where we see Barton’s face trace in progress. She checks the stats. ...laptops, if it’s connected to a satellite, it’s eyes and ears for us. NATASHA It’s still not gonna find them in time. BANNER You have to narrow your field. How many Spectrometers do you have access to? FURY How many are there? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 37. BANNER Call every lab you know. Tell them to put the Spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for Gamma rays. I’ll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work? FURY Agent Romanoff, would you show Doctor Banner to his laboratory, please? Natasha walks over to Banner and they begin walking out of the bridge area. NATASHA You’re gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys. BANNER Really? Do you have the com-meter sixty-four? NATASHA I’m not sure- BANNER (cutting her off) Oh you’re very young. Fury walks up to Hill. FURY Hill, did you tell the council that Barton had been compromised? MARIA HILL Was that not procedure? Fury walks off the bridge and onto the air deck, where he looks out. MARIA HILL (CONT’D) Did you tell them who exactly is on your response team? Fury looks over his shoulder. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 38. FURY Doesn’t appear that I have to. 51 INT. LOKI’S LIAR, UNDERGROUND LAB - DAY 51 Selvig is working on a machine in Loki’s hidden base. SELVIG Put it over there. (to Barton) Where did you find all these people? BARTON SHIELD has no shortage of enemies, Doctor. This the stuff you need? SELVIG Yeah. Iridium. It’s found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It’s very hard to get hold of. BARTON Especially if SHIELD knows you need it. SELVIG Well, I didn’t know. Loki walks up. (to Loki) Hey! This is wonderful. The Tesseract has shown me so much. It’s- it’s more than knowledge, it’s truth. LOKI I know. It, ah- it touches everyone differently. (to Barton) What did it show you Agent Barton? BARTON My next target. SELVIG (laughing) Stick in the mud. He’s got no soul. No wonder you chose this, this tomb to work in. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 39. BARTON (snapping) Well, the Radisson doesn’t have three levels of lead lined flooring between SHIELD and that Cube. Selvig walks back to the machine he was working on. LOKI I see why Fury chose you to guard it. BARTON You’re going to have to contend with him sir. As long as he’s in the air, I can’t pin him down. And he’ll be putting together a team. LOKI Are they a threat? BARTON To each other more than likely. But if Fury can get ’em on track, and he might, they could throw some noise our way. LOKI You admire Fury. BARTON He’s got a clear line of sight. LOKI Is that why you failed to kill him? BARTON It might be. I was disoriented, and I’m not at my best with a gun. LOKI I want to know everything you can tell me about this team of his. I would- test their mettle. Barton nods. I am weary of scuttling in shadow. I mean to rule this world, not burrow in it. BARTON That’s a risk (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 40. LOKI Oh yes. BARTON If you’re set on making yourself known. I could be useful. LOKI Tell me what you need. Barton walks over to a small case, opens it, then takes out his bow. He flicks it open. BARTON I need a distraction. And an eyeball. 52 INT. BRIDGE, CARRIER - DAY 52 Coulson and Steve are standing in the bridge, just waiting. AGENT JASPER SITWELL is in the b.g. running the face trace. AGENT COULSON I mean, if it’s not too much trouble. STEVE No-no, it’s fine. AGENT COULSON It’s a vintage set. Took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges but- AGENT JASPER SITWELL We got a hit. Sixty seven percent match. Wait- cross-match, seventy nine percent. AGENT COULSON Location? AGENT JASPER SITWELL Stuttgart, Germany. Twenty eight, Königstraße. He’s not exactly hiding. FURY Captain, you’re up. Steve nods and walks off.41. 53 EXT. FANCY BUILDING, STUTTGART - NIGHT 53 A busy street. Cars pull up and drop off fancy guests. 54 INT. FANCY BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 54 String quartet No. 13 is playing in a large ballroom filled with people talking, mingling. 55 INT.

GUARDED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 56 Two guards outside are shot down with arrows while securing the building. 57 EXT. QUINJET, SKIES - CONTINUOUS 57 The quinjet is speeding across the cloudy skies, making its way to Germany. 58 EXT. DOOR, GUARDED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 58 Barton and some men rush over to a door with a scanner on the side. They prepare to break in. 59 INT. FANCY BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 59 Loki walks down some stairs from a balcony. GALA SCIENTIST is at a podium talking. Loki hits a man with his scepter, knocking him to the floor. The guests stop and stare in awe. Loki swiftly grabs the GALA SCIENTIST -- flips him onto a statue and then uses a device to bore into his eye. The guests scatter in horror, screaming, running away as Loki smiles menacingly. 60 EXT. DOOR, GUARDED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 60 The image of the eye is transported to a similar device Barton is holding over a retina scanner. The door opens. 61 INT.

FANCY BUILDING, STUTTGART - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 62 People flee the gala, screaming, and Loki follows, taking on his Asgardian attire. He blasts a Polizei (police) car speeding toward him, flipping it over. He creates duplicates of himself, surrounding a mob of gala people. LOKI Kneel before me. I said- KNEEL! The people hurry, dropping to their knees. (walking through the mob) Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It’s the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life’s joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made- to be ruled. In the end- you will always kneel. A German old man gets to his feet. GERMAN OLD MAN Not to men like you. LOKI There are no men like me. GERMAN OLD MAN There are always men like you. LOKI Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. Loki fires his scepter but Captain America jumps in front of the man -- deflecting the beam off his shield causing it to hit Loki, who falls to the ground. CAPTAIN AMERICA You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing. LOKI The soldier- Loki rises to his feet. -the man out of time. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 43. CAPTAIN AMERICA I’m not the one who’s out of time. The quinjet comes in behind Cap with Black Widow inside. A gun unfolds from the underside of the plane. NATASHA (over speaker) Loki, drop the weapon and stand down. Loki fires at the jet and it banks hard to avoid it. Cap attacks Loki and the two fight. Loki knocks Cap’s shield to the side and forces him down with his scepter. LOKI Kneel! CAPTAIN AMERICA Not today. Cap jumps up and does a spin-kick to Loki’s face. The two continue to fight. 63 INT. COCKPIT, QUINJET - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 63 Natasha, in her Black Widow suit, is trying to figure out how to take a shot. NATASHA (to co-pilot) Guy’s all over the place. TONY (over earpiece) Agent Romanoff, you miss me? The computer screen shows the message ’PA SYSTEMS OVERRIDE’, and AC/DC’s, ’Shoot to Thrill’ begins to play. Natasha smiles heavily. Iron Man flies down and fires a repulsor blast, knocking Loki down. IRON MAN Make a move reindeer games. Loki’s Asgardian garb fades away and he raises his hands. Good move. Cap walks over to Iron Man. The quinjet begins to land in the b.g. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 44. CAPTAIN AMERICA Mister Stark. IRON MAN Captain. 64 EXT. DARKENED CLOUDY SKIES - NIGHT 64 DOLLY IN on some mountains in the distance...the quinjet speeds by. 65 INT. COCKPIT, QUINJET - CONTINUOUS 65 Natasha is piloting the plane. Loki is strapped down in the back of the plane. Cap, in suit but no cowl, and Tony, in the suit but without the helmet, is standing behind the cockpit and they talking. FURY (over quinjet radio) He saying anything? NATASHA (into headset) Not a word. FURY (over quinjet radio) Just get him here, we’re low on time. 66 INT. QUINJET - CONTINUOUS 66 STEVE I don’t like it. TONY What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily? STEVE I don’t remember it being that easy. This guy packs a wallop. TONY Still, you were pretty spry, for an older fellow. What’s your thing? Pilates? STEVE What? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 45. TONY It’s like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple of things. Y’know, doing time as a Cap-sicle. STEVE Fury didn’t tell me he was calling you in. TONY Yeah, there’s a lot of things Fury doesn’t tell you. There’s a flash of lightening and a roar of thunder. NATASHA Where’s this come from? Loki leans forward, looking around. STEVE (to Loki) What’s the matter? Scared of a little lightening? LOKI I’m not overly fond of what follows. Loki looks to the sky. 67 EXT. DARKENED STORMY SKIES - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 67 There’s a crash on top of the quinjet. Something as landed. 68 INT. QUINJET - CONTINUOUS 68 Tony, Steve, and Natasha look up. SHOCKED and JOLTED. 69 EXT. DARKENED STORMY SKIES - CONTINUOUS 69 There seems to be a shadowy figure holding onto the quinjet. We make it out -- this is THOR ODINSON, God of Thunder. He is serious. There’s another flash of light. 70 INT. QUINJET - CONTINUOUS 70 Natasha speeds up. Steve runs for something, he grabs his cowl while Tony grabs his helmet which attaches itself to the suit. Tony pushes a button and opens the ramp of the jet. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 46. CAPTAIN AMERICA What are you doing? Thor enters, jumping down on the ramp. He hits Iron Man away, causing him to fall on Cap. He grabs Loki by the neck and jumps out of the plane. IRON MAN Now there’s that guy. NATASHA Another Asgardian? CAPTAIN AMERICA That guy’s a friendly. NATASHA Doesn’t matter. If he frees Loki, or kills him, the Tesseract’s lost. Iron Man begins walking to the edge of the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA Stark, we need a plan of attack. IRON MAN I have a plan. Attack! Iron Man flies out of the jet and Cap makes for a parachute. NATASHA I’d sit this one out, Cap. CAPTAIN AMERICA I don’t see how I can. NATASHA These guys come from legend, they’re basically Gods. CAPTAIN AMERICA There’s only one God ma’am, and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t dress like that. Cap straps on the chute, grabs his shield, and dives out the plane, head first.47. 71 EXT. CLIFF TOP - NIGHT 71 Thor and Loki crash down on a cliff. Thor throws Loki to the ground, he groans. THOR Where is the Tesseract? LOKI Oh-ho, I missed you too. THOR Do I look to be in a gaming mood? LOKI Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone, how many dark energy did the All-Father have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth. Thor drops his hammer, Mjolnir, and pulls Loki to his feet. THOR I thought you dead. LOKI Did you mourn? THOR We all did. Our father- LOKI Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? THOR We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that? LOKI I remember a shadow, living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I who was and should be king! THOR So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights? No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 48. LOKI Well yes. THOR Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill. Loki pushes past Thor and walks away, Thor follows. LOKI I’ve seen worlds you’ve never known about. I have grown, Odinson, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it- THOR Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king? LOKI I am a king! THOR Not here. You give up the Tesseract; you give up this poisonous dream! You come home. LOKI I don’t have it. Thor summons Mjolnir and holds it ready. You need the Cube to bring me home but I’ve sent it off I know not where. THOR You listen well brother- Iron Man flies in, knocking him and Thor out of frame. Loki stands waiting. LOKI I’m listening? 72 EXT. FOREST - SECONDS LATER 72 Thor and Iron Man crash through the trees to the ground, Tony lifts his faceplate. THOR Do not touch me again. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 49. TONY Then don’t take my stuff. THOR You have no idea what you’re dealing with. TONY Uh- Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you wear-th her drapes? THOR This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice. TONY He gives up the Cube, he’s all yours. Until then- Faceplate drops. IRON MAN -stay out of the way. Iron Man takes a few steps. Tourist. Thor throws Mjolnir, hitting Iron Man square in the chest, sending him flying, landing on his back. INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET: TONY Okay! BACK TO SCENE: Loki smirks from the cliff top as Thor summons Mjolnir then swings it in circles. Iron Man gets to his feet and fires a repulse blast at Thor, then flies at him, kicking him through a tree. Thor stands, summoning a bolt of lightning as Loki watches in the distance. Thor sends the bolt at Iron Man. INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET: JARVIS Power at four hundred percent capacity. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 50. TONY How bout that? BACK TO SCENE: Iron Man fires at Thor. The two stand ready then fly at each other, smashing through the trees and scraping up a cliff side. Trees are toppled as they crash to the forest grounds. Thor and Iron Man stand quickly. Thor sends in a left hook so Iron Man is about to punch but Thor grabs his fist. Iron Man is about to send in his left hook and Thor grabs that too. Thor begins to crush Iron Man’s right gauntlet with ease. INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET: Tony looks at the HUD which is alerting him. He groans and thinks. BACK TO SCENE: Iron Man lifts his palm, that is being crushed, and he fires a blast at Thor’s face -- it does nothing to Thor so he head butts him. Thor headbutts him back. Iron Man flies back, coming to a stop before launching himself at Thor. Iron Man throws Thor into a broken tree. Thor then stands and the two go at it for a bit longer -- a fist fight. Thor summons his hammer about to slam down on the chest of Tony but Iron Man ditches, causing Thor to fall. Behind the rising Thor, Iron Man swoops in and punches him. They get ready to sends blows at each other until Cap’s shield ricochets off both their chest. CAPTAIN AMERICA (O.S) Hey! Cap catches his shield. CAPTAIN AMERICA That’s enough! He jumps down of the tree and approaches Thor and Iron Man. Now I don’t know what you plan on doing here- THOR I’ve come here to put an end to Loki’s schemes! (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 51. CAPTAIN AMERICA Then prove it. Put that hammer down. IRON MAN Uh, yeah! No! Bad call, he loves his hammer- Thor swings his hammer back, sending Iron Man behind him. THOR You want me to put hammer down? Thor leaps, swinging Mjolnir, Cap raises the shield over his head. When the two connect there is a loud boom and a flash of light. The three are thrown backwards. They slowly get to their feet and come together. CAPTAIN AMERICA Are we done here? Thor looks around. 73 EXT. HELICARRIER, SKIES - NIGHT 73 The helicarrier flies through the clouds. 74 INT. HALL, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 74 Loki is escorted down the halls by a troop of armed guards. He walks past a window -- the wishbone lab, where Banner is working. Loki smiles through the window at him. Banner removes his glasses and rubs his temples. 75 INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 75 Loki is locked in a cylindrical glass cage. Fury walks in and over to a control panel. FURY In case it’s unclear, you try to escape- you so much as scratch that glass- Fury pushes a button and the floor beneath the cell drops away to nothing, the wind screams. Thirty thousand feet straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works? He pushes a button and closes the floor. He gestures first to Loki. Ant. (gestures to panel) Boot. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 52. LOKI It’s an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me. FURY Built for something a lot stronger than you. LOKI Oh I’ve heard. (turns to a camera)... 76 INT. CONFERENCE TABLE, BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 76 On the glass table a monitor is up -- Loki on it, watching it is Natasha. As Loki talks she looks up at Banner. Banner looks at her, smirking about her cage comment earlier. ...A mindless beast- makes play he’s still a man... We see Thor listen intently. ...How desperate are you, that you call on such lost creatures to defend you? FURY (V.O) How desperate am I? ... 77 INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 77 Fury moves toward the cage slowly. ...You threaten my world with war, you steal a force you can’t hope to control, you talk about peace and you kill ’cause it’s fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did. LOKI Ooh. It burns you to have come so close, to have the Tesseract, to have power- unlimited power, and for what? (smiles and faces the camera) A... 78 INT. BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 78 Hill is watching Loki on a screen too. ...warm light for all mankind to share?53. 79 INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 79 Loki faces Fury again. And then to be reminded what real power is. Fury smiles. FURY Well, let me know if ’real power’ wants a magazine or something. Fury exits. 80 INT. CONFERENCE TABLE, BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 80 The monitor on Cap’s side of the table turns off. Steve, in suit with no cowl, looks up. BANNER He really grows on you doesn’t he? STEVE Loki’s gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what’s his play? THOR He has an army called the Chitauri. They’re not of Asgard nor any world known. He means to lead the against your people. They will win him the Earth, in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract. STEVE An army, from outer space? BANNER So, he’s building another portal. That’s what he needs Erik Selvig for. THOR Selvig? BANNER He’s an astrophysicist. THOR He’s a friend. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 54. NATASHA Loki has them under some kind of spell- along with one of ours. STEVE I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He’s not leading an army from here. BANNER I don’t think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you can small crazy on him. THOR Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason but he is of Asgard, and he is my brother. NATASHA He killed eighty people in two days. THOR He’s adopted? BANNER I think it’s about the mechanics. Iridium, what do they need the Iridium for? Tony and Coulson come walking in. TONY It’s a stabilizing agent. (to Coulson, quietly) I’m saying, take a weekend; I’ll fly you to Portland. Keep love alive. Coulson peels off from Tony, who is heading over to Thor. Means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. (to Thor) No hard feelings point break, you got a mean swing. Thor gives Tony a look as he walks to the control panels. TONY Also, means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 55. (to SHIELD personnel) Ah, raise the mizzen mast, ship the topsails. The personnel look at him strangely. That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did. Standing now at the command area of the ship, Tony covers one eye. (to Hill) How does Fury even see these? MARIA HILL (attitude) He turns! TONY Sounds exhausting! He begins messing with the screens, sticking something to the underside of a desk. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source- of high energy density. Something to- kick start the Cube. MARIA HILL When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics? TONY Last night. The packet, Selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers- am I the only one who did the reading? STEVE Does Loki need any particular kind of power source? BANNER He’s have to heat the Cube to a hundred and twenty million kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier. TONY Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the Quantum Tunneling effect. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 56. BANNER Well, if he could do that he could achieve heavy-ion fusion at any reactor on the planet. TONY Finally. Someone who speaks English. STEVE (to the others) Is that what just happened? Stark and Banner shake hands. TONY It’s good to meet you, Doctor Banner. Your work on anti-electronic collisions is unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of the way you- lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. BANNER ...Thanks. Fury enters. FURY Doctor Banner is only here to track the Cube. I was hoping you might join him. STEVE I’d start with that stick of his. It may be magical but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon. FURY I don’t know about that, but it is powered by the Cube. And I like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. THOR Monkeys? I do not understand- STEVE I do! The entire room goes instantly silent, staring at Steve. (MORE) (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (5) 57. STEVE (CONT’D) I...I understood that reference. TONY Shall we play, Doctor? BANNER This way, sir. The two men walk off. ON A SHIELD WORKER: He resumes play Galaga again. 81 INT. WISHBONE LAB, CARRIER - NIGHT 81 Banner and Stark are working on tracking the Cube. Banner is scanning the scepter with a device. BANNER The Gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig’s reports on the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take weeks to process. Stark works on a screen. TONY If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster we can clock this at around six hundred teraflops. BANNER All I packed was a toothbrush. TONY (giggles a bit) You know, you should come by Stark Tower some time. Top ten floors- all R and D. You’d love it, it’s a candy land. BANNER Thanks but...last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem. TONY Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension, no surprises. He zaps Banner in the side. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 58. BANNER Ow! STEVE Hey! TONY Nothing? Steve approaches. STEVE Are you nuts? TONY Jury’s out! (to Banner) You really have got a lid on it, haven’t you? What’s your secret? Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed? STEVE Is everything a joke to you? TONY Funny things are. STEVE Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn’t funny. No offense, Doc. BANNER No it’s alright. I wouldn’t have come aboard if I couldn’t handle pointy things. TONY You’re tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut. STEVE And you need to focus on the problem, Mister Stark. TONY You think I’m not? Why did Fury call us in? Why now, why not before? What isn’t he telling us? I can’t do the equation unless I have all the variables. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 59. STEVE You think Fury’s hiding something? TONY He’s a spy. Captain, he’s the spy. His secrets have secrets. He gestures to Banner. It’s bugging him to, isn’t it? BANNER Uh, Aah, I just wanna finish my work here and- STEVE Doctor? BANNER A warm light for all mankind,\" Loki’s jab at Fury about the Cube. STEVE I heard it. BANNER Well, I think that was meant for you. He gestures to Stark, who offers him a blueberry. Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news. STEVE The Stark Tower? That big ugly- Stark gives him a look. -building in New York? BANNER It’s powered by an arc reactor, self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for, what, a year? TONY It’s just the prototype. (to Rodgers) I’m kind of the only name in clean energy right now, that’s what he’s getting at. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 60. BANNER So, why didn’t SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? What are they even doing in the energy business in the first place? TONY I should probably look into that as soon as my decryption program finishes breaking into all of SHIELD’s secure files. STEVE I’m sorry did you say- TONY JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours I’ll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. Blueberry? STEVE Yet you’re confused about why they didn’t want you around. TONY An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome. STEVE I think Loki’s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war and if we don’t stay focused he’ll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them. TONY Following’s not really my style. STEVE And you’re all about style, aren’t you? TONY Out of the people in this room, which one is \"A\" wearing a spangly outfit and \"B\" not of use? BANNER Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (5) 61. STEVE Just find the Cube. Cap exits the lab, pauses and turns, walking off in another direction. TONY That’s the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn’t have kept him on ice. BANNER Guy’s not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us. TONY What he’s got is an ACME dynamite kit. It’s gonna blow up in his face, and I’m gonna be there when it does. BANNER I’ll read all about it. TONY Mhm, or, you’ll be suiting up with the rest of us. BANNER Now, you see I don’t get a suit of armor. I’m exposed, like a nerve, it’s a nightmare. TONY You know, I’ve got a cluster shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it- He taps the arc reactor. -this little circle of light. It’s part of me now, not just armor. It’s a terrible privilege. BANNER But you can control it. TONY Because I learned how. BANNER It’s different. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (6) 62. Tony wipes clean the screen between them that Banner was working on. TONY Hey, I read all about your accident. That much Gamma exposure- should’ve killed you. BANNER So you’re saying that the Hulk- the Other Guy- saved my life? That’s nice. That’s nice sentiment. Saved it for- what? TONY I guess we’ll find out. BANNER You may not enjoy that. TONY And you just might. 82 INT. STORAGE ROOM, CARRIER - EARLY DAWN 82 Cap forces open the entrance to a storage room.

AGENT COULSON He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here. THOR They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we’re more advanced, but we- we come here battling like Bildschneip. AGENT COULSON Like what? THOR Bildschneip. You know, huge, scaly, big antlers. You don’t have those? AGENT COULSON No. THOR Huh! Well they are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path. Thor moves over to a large window. When I first came to earth, Loki’s rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. FURY War hasn’t started yet. You think you can make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is? THOR I do not know. Loki’s mind is far afield, it’s not just power he craves, it’s vengeance upon me. There’s no pain would prise his need from him. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 64. FURY A lot of guys think that, until the pain starts. THOR What are you asking me to do? FURY I’m asking, what are you prepared to do? THOR Loki is a prisoner. FURY Then why do I feel like he’s the only person on this boat that wants to be here? 86 INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - DAWN 86 Loki is pacing in the cell. Natasha walks up behind him. LOKI Hm. There’s not many people that can sneak up on me. NATASHA But you figured I’d come.

LOKI I’d say I’ve expanded his mind. NATASHA And once you’ve won. Once you’re king of the mountain. What happens to his mind? LOKI Is this love, Agent Romanoff? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 65. NATASHA Love is for children. I owe him a debt. LOKI Tell me. NATASHA Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh- well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skill set. I didn’t care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD’s radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call. LOKI And what will you do if I vow to spare him? NATASHA Not let you out. LOKI Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man? NATASHA Regime’s fall everyday. I tend not to weep over that, I’m Russian, or I was. LOKI And what are you now? NATASHA It’s really not that complicated. I got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out. LOKI Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? Drakov’s daughter? Sao Paulo? The hospital fire? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it’s gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child, a prayer. Pathetic66. 87 INT.

Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear. Natasha becomes scared out of her mind.

Sounds of Natasha sobbing. Her head hangs low. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 67. NATASHA You’re a monster! LOKI (grinning menacingly) Oh, no. You brought the monster. Natasha lifts her head and turns to face Loki -- her face is dry. NATASHA So, Banner? That’s your play. LOKI What? Natasha begins to exit the room. NATASHA (into earpiece) Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I’m on my way. Send Thor as well. She stops and faces Loki. Thank you, for your cooperation! Natasha skimmers off. 91 INT. WISHBONE LAB, CARRIER - MORNING 91 Fury enters. FURY What are you doing, Mr. Stark? TONY Uh- kind of been wondering the same thing about you. FURY You’re supposed to be locating the Tesseract. BANNER We are, the model’s locked and we’re sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we’ll have the location within half a mile. TONY And you’ll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. What is Phase Two? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 68. Steve enters, and slams a large HYDRA gun on the table. STEVE Phase Two is SHIELD used the Cube to make weapons. (to Tony) Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me. FURY Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we’re- TONY I’m sorry, Nick. Tony turns the screen towards Fury. It shows a plan for some a missile. What were you lying? STEVE I was wrong, Director. The world hasn’t changed a bit. Thor and Natasha enter. Banner looks to her. BANNER Did you know about this? NATASHA You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor? BANNER (laughs) I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed. NATASHA Loki’s manipulating you. BANNER And you’ve been doing what exactly? NATASHA You didn’t come here because I bat my eyelashes at you. BANNER Yes, and I’m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. (MORE) (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 69. BANNER (CONT’D) I’d like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction. FURY (pointing at Thor) Because of him. THOR Me?

THOR My people want nothing but peace with your planet. FURY But you’re not the only people out there, are you? And, you’re not the only threat. The world’s filling up with people who can’t be matched, they can’t be controlled. STEVE Like you controlled the cube! THOR Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for A HIGHER FORM OF WAR. STEVE A higher form?! FURY You forced our hand! We had to come up with some- TONY Nuclear deterrent! ’Cause that always calms everything right down. Everyone becomes hostile and begin cutting each other off. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (4) 70.

STEVE I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. I’ve seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you. TONY I think I would just cut the wire. STEVE Always a way out.

FURY (to himself) They are not getting through here so what the- Barton fires arrows from above and they explode. He fires another which hits the control panel. Fury sees him and begins to shoot, while the arrow, having hit a plug, hacks the helicarrier systems, causing a second engine to malfunction, it’s dead. INTERCOM VOICE Engine One is now in shutdown.

LOWER ENGINE ROOM, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 127 Natasha sits in the carnage of the Hulk’s rampage, shaking. She slowly lifts a hand to her earpiece.

He shoots another arrow, which she dodges by dropping across to the next passage. Barton follows her. They fight along that catwalk. The fight is very even. Barton tries hitting her with the bow and she pulls on the string. They fight some more, headbutting and punching. They both pull daggers.86. 131 INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS (DAY) 131 Thor his the cage with his hammer, the cage cracks but it begins to shake off the bolts and shudders. LOKI (laughs) The humans think us immortal. Shall we test that? Loki moves to open the chute beneath the cell, dropping Thor to, what for any regular person, would be certain death. Coulson suddenly appears, wielding a large prototype Phase Two weapon. AGENT COULSON Move away please. Loki steps back from the panel. Coulson gestures to the gun. Do you like this? We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer. Even I don’t know what it does. Do you wanna find out? Coulson prepares to fire the weapon when Loki disappears, reappearing behind him and thrusting the point of his spear through Coulson’s chest. He yells and drops to the floor. THOR NO! Loki returns to the panel, opening the chute and pressing the button which sends the cell, and Thor, falling from the ship. 132 INT. ENGINE ROOM, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS 132 Natasha and Barton are still fighting. Natasha grabs Barton arm and thrusts it back. He groans as he throws the dagger to his free hand.

AGENT COULSON You lack conviction. LOKI I don’t think I- Coulson fires the weapon, which shoots a blast of fire similar to that of the Destroyer, sending Loki flying through a wall.

INTERCUT: CAP / IRON MAN HELMET Cap still hangs from the side of the ship by a power cord. STEVE i need a minute here! TONY Lever! Now! Cap hauls himself up. END INTERCUT Iron Man is pushed back up against one of the rotors, now spinning too fast for him to escape. INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET: TONY (CONT’D) Uh-oh.

CONFERENCE TABLE, BRIDGE, CARRIER - DAY 144 Steve, Tony, and Fury are gathered at a table. Hill stands to the side. Fury pulls a handful of cards out. FURY These were in Phil Coulson’s jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them. Fury scatters them on the table. Some are wet with blood. We’re dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Think I had that coming. Fury begins to make his way around the table to Steve and Tony. Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number, though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative. Fury reaches a chair between Tony and Steve The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes. Tony stands and walks out. Well, it’s an old fashioned notion.91. 145 EXT. REMOTE FIELD - DAY 145 Thor is making his way over to Mjolnir. He hesitates to pick it up, fearing he is not worthy. He clenches his fist. 146 INT.

SECURITY GUARD Are you an alien? BANNER What? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 92. SECURITY GUARD From outer space, an alien? BANNER No. SECURITY GUARD Well then, son, you’ve got a condition. Banner steps down from the pile of rubble in the warehouse, pulling on the shirt. SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D) So, which one is it? BANNER Sorry? SECURITY GUARD Are you a big guy that gets all little, or a little guy that, ah- sometimes blows up large? BANNER You know- I’m not even sure. SECURITY GUARD You got somewhere to go? BANNER Stark Tower. I- no. The Security Guard looks at him. Yes. SECURITY GUARD I’d expect some confusion of the mind, since your body’s kind of all over the place, but it has to be one or the other. The Security Guard gestures Banner to follow him. BANNER I know where I could do the most good, but it’s where I can do the most harm. SECURITY GUARD Well, that’s no different than anybody else. They walk out the doors. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 93. Me? I’m here is Jersey where I can’t do much of either. And since I’m not likely to move on from this placement, you may as well- pilfer my ride. The Security Guard gestures to an old motorcycle. BANNER I don’t know which way to go.

I have to flush him out. NATASHA You gotta level out, it’s gonna take time. BARTON You don’t understand. Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and stuff something else in? You know what it’s like to be unmade? NATASHA You know that I do. BARTON Why am I back? How did you get him out? NATASHA Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard in the head. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 94. BARTON Thanks. Natasha begins to remove the strap restraints. Natasha, how many agents? NATASHA Don’t. Don’t do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for. BARTON Loki. He get away? NATASHA Yeah. I don’t suppose you know where? BARTON Didn’t need to know. Didn’t ask. He’s gonna make his play soon though. Today. Natasha walks to the door. NATASHA We gotta stop him. BARTON Yeah? Who’s we? NATASHA I don’t know. Whoever is left. BARTON Well, if I put an arrow through Loki’s eye socket I’d sleep better I suppose. NATASHA Now you sound like you. BARTON But you don’t. You’re a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you? NATASHA He didn’t, I just- (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 95. BARTON Natasha. NATASHA I’ve been compromised. I got red in my ledger.

TONY For taking on Loki alone. STEVE He was doing his job. TONY He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have- STEVE Sometimes there isn’t a way out, Tony. TONY Right. How did that work for him? STEVE Is this the first time you’ve lost a soldier? (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 96. TONY We are not soldiers! I’m not marching to Fury’s fife. STEVE Neither am I. He’s got the same blood on his hands that Loki does, but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list- Tony looks down at the place Coulson fell, there is a dent in the wall. TONY He made it personal. STEVE That’s not the point. TONY That is the point. That’s Loki’s point. He hit us all right where we live. Why? STEVE To tear us apart. TONY Yeah, divide and conquer is great but- he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That’s what he wants. He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience. STEVE Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart. TONY Yeah. That’s just previews, this is- this is opening night. And Loki, he’s a full-tail diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered....Son of-a-bitch.97. 149 EXT.

JARVIS Sir, I turned off the arc reactor. The device is already self-sustaining IRON MAN Shut it down, Dr. Selvig. JARVIS It’s too late! She can’t stop now. She wants to show us something! A new universe. IRON MAN (annoyed) Okay. He fires at the barrier around the device, but the Tesseract deflects it, sending the energy outwards, knocking Selvig out and Iron Man back. JARVIS The barrier is pure energy. It’s unbreachable. IRON MAN Yeah, I got that. Iron Man looks down to see Loki on the platform outside the penthouse. I’m beat. JARVIS Sir, the Mark Seven is not ready for deployment. INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET: TONY Then skip the spinning rims, we’re on the clock.100.

PENTHOUSE, STARK TOWER - CONTINUOUS 155 Inside the tower, Loki walks forward as Tony goes behind his bar. LOKI Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity. TONY Uh- actually, I’m planning to threaten you. LOKI You should have left your armor on for that. TONY Yeah, it’s seen a bit of mileage. You’ve got the uh- blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink? LOKI Stalling me won’t change anything. TONY No, no, no- threatening. No drink? You sure? I’m having one. LOKI The Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear? TONY The Avengers. It’s what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. ’Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’ type of thing. LOKI Yes, I’m met them. TONY Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I’ll give you that one. But, let’s do a head count here. Your brother, the Demi-God; (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (2) 101. Loki turns away and Tony slips a pair of bracelets onto his wrists. A super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you’ve managed to piss off every single one of them. LOKI That was the plan. Tony begins to walk to the center of the penthouse where Loki is. TONY Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they’ll come for you. LOKI I have an army. TONY We have a Hulk. LOKI Oh, I thought the beast had wandered off. TONY Yeah- you’re missing the point. There’s no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it’s too much for us, but it’s all on you. ’Cause if we can’t protect the earth, you can be damned well sure we’ll avenge it. Loki walks over to Tony, pointing his scepter. LOKI How will your friends have time for me, when they’re so busy fighting you? Loki walks up to Tony, and places the tip of the scepter over his heart. It clinks against the arc reactor. This usually works. (CONTINUED)CONTINUED: (3) 102. TONY Well, performance issues. You know? Loki grabs Tony by the throat and throws him across the room. JARVIS, anytime now. Loki grabs Tony again. LOKI You will all fall before me. TONY JARVIS. Deploy. Loki sends Stark crashing through the window, and plummeting toward the ground. TONY (O.S) Deploy!

Barton grabs a arrow and shoots it, hitting one alien in the head, the arrow quickly separates into more arrows, killing three Chitauri aliens. Cap leaves the other two fighting and jumps off an overpass, rolling onto a bus and into the street. Barton helps people off a bus as Natasha shoots her pistols at Chitauri.
