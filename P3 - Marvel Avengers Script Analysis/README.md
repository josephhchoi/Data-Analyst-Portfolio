# Marvel Avengers Script Analysis

## About the Project
Welcome to my Marvel Avengers Script Analysis (NER Model) project!

The objective of this project is to develop a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model based on key phrases and a text summarization model to outline the script. 

Throughout this project, I demonstrate my expertise in various text analytics and natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including:
- **Data Preparation**: Parsing and cleaning text data
- **Determining Word Frequency**: Calculating the frequency of each word in the script and extracting character names
- **Custom NER Model Training**: Utilizing a blank spaCy model to define "Character" labels and apply an entity ruler to the script
- **Text Analysis**: Collecting character frequencies to gain insights into the number of times each prominent character appears in the script
- **Text Summarization**: Condensing the script into a concise summary

## Regarding the Dataset

**Text Corpus**: The dataset consists of a PDF file containing the script for the movie "Marvel Avengers." The file contains dialogue and conversations between characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <br>

## Project Workflow
The Script Analysis project involves several key steps. First, the scriptâ€™s PDF file is acquired from the Kaggle dataset to be extracted as text data. After performing necessary data cleaning, a custom NER model is trained to identify character entities. The model's output calculates character appearance frequency and analyzes prominent character trends. Lastly, advanced NLP techniques are employed to create a text summarization model to summarize the script into meaningful summaries that capture its key themes.
