# Healthcare ER Analysis

## About the Project
Welcome to Healthcare Analytics: ER Insight!

Please note that Health-Tech Analytics is a fictional Data Firm that specializes in providing data analysis and solutions to hospitals and emergency rooms. 

This project showcases my proficiency in performing comprehensive data analysis of emergency room (ER) data. Throughout this project, I demonstrate my expertise in three key areas:

- Data Mining (SQL)
- Data Visualization (Excel)
- Data Visualization (Tableau)

## Regarding the Dataset
**Description**: <br>
The dataset for this project comprises emergency room (ER) data from various hospitals. This dataset contains information for conducting a comprehensive exploration of ER operations and patient experiences.

**Data Fields**: <br>
- **date**: The date and time of the ER visit.
- **patient_id**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **patient_gender**: Gender of the patient.
- **patient_age**: Age of the patient at the time of the ER visit.
- **patient_sat_score**: Numerical score representing patient satisfaction (ranging from 0 to 10).
- **patient_first_initial**: First initial of the patient's first name.
- **patient_last_name**: Last name of the patient.
- **patient_race**: Race of the patient.
- **patient_admin_flag**: Binary flag for patient admission to the hospital (TRUE: Admitted / FALSE: Not Admitted).
- **patient_waittime**: The time (min) the patient waited before receiving medical attention.
- **department_referral**: The department to which the patient was referred for further treatment.

**Dataset Location**: <br>

## Project Objective
1.	**Patient Demographics Analysis**: Explore patient demographics, including age, gender, and race.
2.	**Patient Satisfaction Analysis**: Analyze patient satisfaction scores to identify trends and areas for improvement in the ER services.
3.	**Admission and Wait Time Analysis**: Examine admission rates and wait times to optimize resource allocation and reduce patient waiting times. 

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Mining (SQL)**: Utilized SQL to analyze and preprocess emergency room (ER) data.
2. **Data Visualization (Excel)**: Leveraged Power Query to import, transform, and shape the data, followed by crafting insightful data viz.
3. **Data Visualization (Tableau)**: Designed an interactive and informative dashboard utilizing the Phase 1 data to enhance data comprehension.
