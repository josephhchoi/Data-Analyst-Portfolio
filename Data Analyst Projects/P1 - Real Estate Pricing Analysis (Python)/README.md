# Real Estate Price Analysis: Uncovering Trends

## About the Project
Welcome to my Real Estate Price Analysis project! 

In this project, I delved deep into real estate data to uncover insights and trends related to property prices. Throughout this analysis, I demonstrate my expertise in three main areas using Python:

- Data Exploration
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Data Visualization

2. **Neighborhood Impact**: Explore the influence of neighborhoods on the distribution of property prices
3. **Garage Features and Price**: Analyze the relationship between garage size features and the corresponding slae prices
4. **Property Condition's Influence**: Investigate how the overall condition of properties influences sale prices
5. **Room Count and Price Correlation**: Examine the correlation between the number of rooms in a property and its sale price

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Exploration**: Dive into the real estate dataset to understand its structure, contents, and patterns.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for analysis by addressing null values and outliers.
3. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to answer important questions about real estate pricing trends and relationships.
