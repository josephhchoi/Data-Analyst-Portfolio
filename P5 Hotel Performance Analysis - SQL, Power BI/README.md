# Hotel Performance Analysis

## About the Project
Welcome to my Hotel Performance Analysis!

This project highlights my capability in conducting thorough data analysis of hotel performance data. Throughout this project, I showcase my proficiency in three core domains:

- Data Import & Consolidation (**SSMS**)
- Data Exploration & Analysis (**SQL**)
- Data Visualization (**Power BI**)

## Regarding the Dataset
