# Supply Chain Data Integration

## About the Project
Welcome to the Supply Chain Data Integration and Reporting project!

In this project, I've designed and implemented a SQL Server database along with reporting tables to support data analysis and reporting needs. This project showcases my proficiency in the following technical skillsets:

- **SSIS**: Data import and transformation processes
- **T-SQL**: Database creation, schema organization, data population, and stored procedures
- **SQL**: Data manipulation, aggregation, and query optimization
