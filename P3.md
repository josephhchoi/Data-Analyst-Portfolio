# P3: Stress Level Predictive Model

In today’s educational landscape, mental health is a major concern, especially for students. As mental health issues continue to rise, it has become evident that managing stress levels is essential as it can significantly impact one’s life and lead to negative outcomes if not handled properly. With students facing constant pressure throughout their day-to-day, it is imperative that we fully understand the factors influencing their stress levels and to what degree. Therefore, our team has decided to analyze the psychological, physiological, social, environmental, and academic stressors faced by students to ultimately develop a predictive model that can forecast stress levels for our third and final project.

To promote our initiatives, we used a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle containing a wide range of factors influencing student stress levels to conduct our analysis and build out our model. The Stress Level dataset consists of 20 influential features categorized into five groups. It is worth noting that all features in this dataset are quantified using standardized scales or categorical ratings.

The main focus of our project revolves around two fundamental research questions:
1. What are the key factors influencing stress levels among students?
2. Can we build a predictive model that can accurately predict stress levels based on these factors?
