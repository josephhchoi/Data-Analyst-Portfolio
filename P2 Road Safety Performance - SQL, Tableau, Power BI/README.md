# Road Safety Performance: Accident & Injury Report

## About the Project
Welcome to my Road Safety Performance project! 

In this project, I analyzed road accident data to uncover insights and trends concerning road accident and injury occurrences. As a result, I developed two distinct dashboards: one focusing on road accident patterns and the other dedicated to road injury trends. Throughout this procedure, I demonstrate my proficiency in the following technical skillsets:

- **SQL**: Data Manipulation, Aggregations, Subqueries, CTEs, CASE, etc.
- **Power BI**: DAX, Power Query, Data Modeling, M Query
- **Tableau**: Advanced Charting, Calculation Field, Parameters, Design Excellence

## Regarding the Dataset
**Description**: <br>
The dataset for this project encompasses a collection of road incident data, providing plethora of information to investigate and analyze trends in road safety performance.

## Project Objective
1. **Temporal Accident Patterns**: Investigate monthly accident trends and variations
2. **Geographical Impact**: Explore the influence of different regions on accident occurrences
3. **Weather Conditions**: Analyze how weather conditions affect accident injuries, and # of vehicles involved
4. **Day-of-the-Week Analysis**: Investigate how accidents are distributed across different days of the week
5. **Accident Severity Assessment**: Evaluate the severity of accidents and their impact on road safety
6. **Road Surface Conditions**: Examine the relationship between road surface conditions and accident severity
7. **Vehicle Type Insights**: Explore the types of vehicles involved in serious accidents

## Project Workflow
1. **SQL**: Extract and employ advanced SQL queries to delve into the dataset and perform in-depth analysis
2. **Power BI**: Develop an interactive dashboard named **Road Safety Performance: Injury Report** for data visualization and insights
3. **Tableau**: Construct a detailed dashboard titled **Road Safety Performance: Accident Report** to provide in-depth insights to road incidents
